It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.[1]Contents1History2Description3Heritage listing4See also5References5.1Bibliography5.2Attribution\n\nHistory[edit]Two separate land grants for 631\u2013635 George Street were issued in 1831. The first was to John Dickson with the second grant to James Blanch on the same day of 8 March 1831. By 1866, Patrick and Mary O'Dowd had purchased land that consisted of both Dickson's' and Davis' grants. In 1880, Mary died and what is now known as 631 George Street, Haymarket, was left to her husband and her brother, and they in turn leased it out to George Barr, who then setup the Haymarket Music Hall. In 1891, the site was then signed over to 'St Joseph's Investment and Building Society' which with the cooperation of O'Dowd, created plans to add an extra two storeys to the building (original construction date unknown). There is evidence that this extension may actually be the current 631 George street site. The original building was only designed for two storeys and it can be seen there are significant interior design differences between the lower and upper floors. Examples include the columns in the central wing and plaster mouldings and detailing to arches around the lobbies.[1]There were constant changes to the owners and occupiers of the building. In 1898 it was known as the Crescent Hotel and its proprietor was Jeffery Monfries. 1899 saw it renamed the Crescent Hotel and Coffee Palace, with proprietor John Eggleton. Between 1907 and 1916 it was known once again as the Crescent Hotel and had five different proprietors.[1]In 1921, renovations were underway to include a shop tenancy on the ground floor. The reason for this was mainly due to the decline in business for pubs due the government restriction of 6\u00a0pm closures.[1]On 18 December 1924 a sublease to Tooheys Limited occurred and another name change. The building was now renamed the George Hotel. The name of George was probably after the moustached man who was the company logo from 1894. During this time, many renovations continued in an attempt to provide better airflow and fresher air into the building as well as more light and better use of the small rooms.[1]In 1939, Tooheys Limited purchased the hotel, and had plans approved to completely rebuild the hotel to a new modern design by Coperman Lemont and Keesing. This was approved by the licensing board but work never commenced.\nIn 1940 an application was approved to delicence the majority of the building. Those affected included the whole of the west wing, the south side of the central wing on the first floor, all of the central wing of the second floor and the entire third floor. In 1941, Tooheys transferred their hotel licence to the New Elizabeth Hotel.[1]The following year Tooheys offered the building to Sydney City Council for amenities. The Church Life and Work Committee of the Presbyterian Church (NSW) were looking for a location for a Hospitality Centre for servicemen and leased the building for one pound a year. Extensive work must have been undertaken at this time to make the building habitable. Volunteers staffed the Centre, which offered 120 beds, full meals, recreation rooms, information, chapel, showers and an ironing and mending facility. British servicemen were particularly attracted to the homely quality of the Centre. The end of the war, in conjunction with increasing operating costs, lead to the closure of the Centre in 1946. After a failed auction an agreement was reached with St Vincent de Paul, who hoped to provide shelter to the homeless. The Commonwealth, however, intervened in 1948 to acquire the property to allow for the expansion of the neighbouring Haymarket Post Office.[1]Since it was sold in 1993 by Australia Post, it remains vacant except for a retail arcade through 631 George Street.[1]Description[edit]Externally 631 George Street is a four-storey high building of face brickwork. Facing east, towards George Street, is a parapeted facade of the Victorian Free Gothic Style. This side is substantially intact and features decorative brickwork and low pointed arches. Much of this detail has been obscured however, by paint. Windows are framed from timber and with the rise of each level, they decrease in size. Shopfronts on the ground floor have been largely altered.[2]\nThe wall to the north of the building is original at east end and the west end of the wall was rebuilt in the 1950s using steel windows with the west wall being rebuilt in the 1940s with possible use of materials from elsewhere in the building..[2] The post office obscures the south wall of the building; however, it is believed that many original windows to the west would be surviving within that wall. Other than the ground floor shops, much of the building is in poor condition.[1]Heritage listing[edit]The George Hotel, which reached its present form c. 1892, is a fine, example of a Victorian free gothic style hotel building surviving in the inner city area of Sydney. The facade is largely intact and features an exuberant use of face brickwork. The general layout and character of the main rooms of the hotel, including the fine timber stair, are reasonably intact.[1]George Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.[1]The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.The former George Hotel is of local significance as a surviving late Victorian hotel building in the inner city area built at a time when the hotel industry was enjoying high prosperity.[1]The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.The former George Hotel is of local significance for its associations with Tooheys Limited, one of Australia's oldest brewing companies.[1]The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.The former George Hotel is of local significance as a fine example of the Victorian free gothic style, as applied to a commercial building.[1]The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.The former George Hotel is of local significance for its associations with the work of the Presbyterian Church (NSW) and servicemen during World War II.[1]The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.The site is of State significance.

Twelve members of the team, aged eleven to sixteen, and their 25-year-old assistant coach entered the cave on 23 June after football practice. Shortly afterwards, heavy rains partially flooded the cave, trapping the group inside.\nEfforts to locate the group were hampered by rising water levels and strong currents, and no contact was made for more than a week. The rescue effort expanded into a massive operation amid intense worldwide public interest. On 2 July, after advancing through narrow passages and muddy waters, British divers John Volanthen and Richard Stanton found the group alive on an elevated rock about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi) from the cave mouth. Rescue organisers discussed various options for extracting the group, including whether to teach them basic diving skills to enable their early rescue, wait until a new entrance was found or drilled, or wait for the floodwaters to subside at the end of the monsoon season months later. After days of pumping water from the cave system and a respite from rain, the rescue teams hastened to get everyone out before the next monsoon rain, which was expected to bring a potential 52\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) of additional rainfall and was predicted to start around 11 July. \nBetween 8 and 10 July, all of the boys and their coach were rescued from the cave by an international team.[10]The rescue effort involved more than 10,000 people, including over 100 divers, many rescue workers, representatives from about 100 governmental agencies, 900 police officers and 2,000 soldiers, and required ten police helicopters, seven police ambulances, more than 700 diving cylinders, and the pumping of more than a billion litres of water out of the caves.\nThere was one fatality, Saman Kunan, a 37-year-old former Thai Navy SEAL who died of asphyxiation on 6 July while returning to a staging base in the cave after delivering supplies of air.\nContents1Disappearance2Search and contact3Planning and preparation3.1Challenges3.2Options3.3The diving option3.4Death of rescue diver4Rescue4.1Recovery5Responses5.1Local5.1.1Opinions about assistant coach5.2International5.2.1Sports world6Timeline7Legacy7.1Possible film7.2Awards8See also9References10External links\n\nDisappearance[edit]  Doi Nang Non, \"Mountain of the Sleeping Lady\". When viewed from this angle, it is said to resemble a lady lying on her back.Play media  Thai news report from NBT news (no subtitles)Tham Luang Nang Non is a karstic cave complex beneath Doi Nang Non, a mountain range on the border between Thailand and Myanmar.[11] The system is 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi) long and has many deep recesses, narrow passages and tunnels winding under hundreds of metres of limestone strata. Since part of the cave system is seasonally flooded, a sign advising against entering the caves during the rainy season (July\u2013November) is posted at the entrance.[12]On Saturday 23 June 2018, a group of twelve boys aged between 11 and 16 from a local junior football team named the Wild Boars and their 25-year-old assistant coach, Ekkaphon Chanthawong,[13] went missing after setting out to explore the cave. According to early news reports, they planned to have a birthday party in the cave after the football practice, and spent a significant sum of money on food, but they refuted this in a news conference after the rescue.[14] The team was stranded in the tunnels by sudden and continuous rainfall after they had entered the cave.[15] They had to leave some food supplies behind when fleeing the rising water.[16][17][18][19]Around 7 p.m., head coach Nopparat Khanthawong (Thai: \u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e31\u0e13\u0e11\u0e30\u0e27\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c) checked his phone, finding about twenty missed calls from parents worried that their children had not come home. Nopparat dialed assistant coach Chanthawong, followed by a number of the boys in quick succession. Eventually, he reached Songpon Kanthawong, a 13-year-old member of the team who mentioned he was picked up after practice, and that the rest of the boys had gone exploring in the Tham Luang caves. The coach raced up to the caves finding abandoned bicycles and bags near the entrance, with water seeping out of the muddy pathway.[20] He alerted authorities to the missing group after seeing their unclaimed belongings.[21]The members of the trapped team were as follows:[18][22]\n\nName (RTGS)\nInformal nameAge\nComments\nChanin WibunrungrueangTitan11Phanumat SaengdiMig13Duangphet PhromthepDom13Team captain.[22]Somphong ChaiwongPong13Mongkhon BunpiamMark13Last to be rescued.[23] Stateless.[24]Natthawut ThakhamsongTern14Rescued in first mission.[25]Ekkarat WongsukchanBew14Adun Sam-onDul14Only English-language speaker; communicated with initial rescue party.[22] Stateless.[24][26]Prachak SuthamNote15Rescued in first mission.[27]Phiphat PhothiNick15Rescued in first mission.[25]Phonchai KhamluangTee16Stateless.[24][26]Phiraphat SomphiangchaiNight16\u201317Celebrated his birthday while in the cave.[19]Ekkaphon ChanthawongAke25Assistant coach and former monk.[22] Stateless.[24][26] Ninth to be rescued.[28]The assistant coach and three of the boys had no nationality. Nopparat Khanthavong, the founder of the Wild Boars team, explained that they are from tribes in an area that extends across Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, and China. This region has no clear borders and people are not assigned passports. Their statelessness deprived them of basic benefits and rights, including the possibility to leave the Chiang Rai province. \"To get nationality is the biggest hope for the boys\", Khanthavong said. \"In the past, these boys have problems traveling to play matches outside of Chiang Rai because of their nationless status.\"[29] Following the team's rescue, Thai officials promised to provide the three boys and the coach with legal assistance in obtaining Thai citizenship, a process which they said could take up to six months.[30] On 26 September, the boys and the coach were granted Thai citizenship.[31]Search and contact[edit]External videoThe first video released by Thai Navy SEALs showing the children and their coach after they were found by British volunteer diversExternal imagesMap, from above, of the Tham Luang cave system, provided by BBC NewsMap, side view, of the Tham Luang cave system, provided by Deutsche Welle  Rescuers looking for alternative access routes to the caveBritish caver Vern Unsworth, who lives in Chiang Rai and has detailed knowledge of the cave complex, was scheduled to make a solo venture into the cave on 24 June when he received a call about the missing boys.[32] Unsworth advised the Thai government to request assistance from the British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC).[32][33] On 25 June, Thai Navy SEALs divers arrived and began searching the cave.[34] A Thai Navy SEAL said the water was so murky that even with lights they could not see where they were going underwater.[35] After continuous rain, which further flooded the entrance, the search had to be periodically interrupted.[36] On 27 June, three BCRC cave divers arrived with specialist equipment including HeyphoneLF radios, followed by separate teams of open water divers. On 28 June, a United States Air Force team of 31st Rescue SquadronPararescue divers joined them. By 29 June, an Australian Federal Police team of Specialist Response Group divers had arrived and on Sunday a Chinese team of divers from the Beijing Peaceland Foundation.[33][37][38][39][40]Meanwhile, policemen with sniffer dogs searched the surface above for shaft openings that could provide alternative entrances to the cave system below. Drones and robots were also used in the search, but no technology existed to scan for people deep underground.[41]BCRC divers Richard Stanton and John Volanthen advanced through the cave complex placing diving guidelines, supported by Thailand-based Belgian cave diver Ben Reymenants [42][43][44][45] and French diver Maksym Polejaka[46][47][48][49][50] The search had to be suspended due to the weather, as rainfall increased the flow of water in the cave where the divers were battling strong currents and poor visibility.[51][52] The search resumed on 2 July after the weather improved. The twelve boys and the coach were discovered at approximately 22:00,[53] by Stanton and Volanthen, whose efforts were overseen from outside by BCRC diver Robert Harper.[54] The boys and  coach were on a narrow rock shelf about 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) beyond the \"Pattaya Beach\" chamber,[53][55][56] named after an above-ground beach in Thailand. Volanthen had been placing guidelines in the cave to assist others in navigation when he ran out of line. He then swam to the surface and soon found the missing  group, smelling them before hearing or seeing them.[57][58] The ledge where they were found is about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi)[59] from the cave mouth.[60] A video of the encounter, showing the boys and their interactions with the divers, was posted on Facebook by the Thai Navy SEALs.[61] In the video, the dazed boys are uncertain how long they have been trapped, as they ask the divers what day it is.[15] Former Chiang Rai provincial governor Narongsak Osatanakorn\u00a0[th], who was in charge of rescue work, said \"We found them safe. But the operation isn't over.\"[62][63] The Thai, US, Australian and Chinese diving teams supported the BCRC divers began transporting diving bottles into the cave system and established an air supply storage area in Chamber 3.[43][64]On 3 July the trapped group were joined by three Thai Navy SEALs who supported them until the rescue. The SEALS included Thai Army doctor Lt. Col. Pak Loharachun of the 3rd Medical Battalion, who had completed the Navy SEALs course.[65][66] Thai officials told reporters that rescuers were providing health checks and treatment and keeping the boys entertained, and that none of those trapped was in serious condition. \"They have been fed with easy-to-digest, high-energy food with vitamins and minerals, under the supervision of a doctor\", Rear Admiral Apagorn Youkonggaew, head of the Thai Navy's Special Forces, told reporters. A video made by the rescuers, and shared a few hours later by the Thai Navy SEALs, showed all twelve boys and their coach introducing themselves and stating their age. Wrapped in emergency blankets and appearing frail, they all said hello to the outside world. \"Sawatdi khrap\", each boy said with his palms together in wai, the traditional Thai greeting.[67] A second video shows a medic treating them.[68] It was believed that some of the group could not swim,[69] complicating what would already be a difficult rescue.[70] The Army doctor discovered that they had attempted to dig their way out of the cave. The team members had used rock fragments to dig every day, creating a hole five metres deep.[66]BCRC diver Jason Mallinson offered the boys and coach an opportunity to send messages to relatives by using his wet notes pad.[51] Many of the notes said they were safe, reassured family members that everything was fine, and included words of love, reassurance and encouragement.[71]Planning and preparation[edit]  Rescue camp near Tham Luang caveA logistics camp was established at the cave entrance, which accommodated hundreds of volunteers and journalists in addition to the rescue workers. The site was divided into several zones: restricted areas for the Thai Navy SEALs, other military personnel, and civilian rescuers, an area for the relatives to give them privacy, and areas for the press and for the general public.[72]An estimated 10,000 people contributed to the rescue effort, including more than 100 divers, representatives from about 100 government agencies, 900 police officers, 2,000 soldiers and numerous volunteers. Equipment included ten police helicopters, seven police ambulances, and more than 700 diving cylinders, of which more than 500 were in the cave at any time while another 200 were in the queue to be refilled. More than a billion litres of water (the equivalent of 400 Olympic-size swimming pools) were removed.[73][74]Challenges[edit]The point where the boys became stranded was about 4 kilometres (2.5\u00a0mi)[59] from the entrance and 800\u20131,000 metres (2,600\u20133,300\u00a0ft) below the top of the mountain.[75] The route to them had several flooded sections, some with strong currents and zero visibility,[76] and some extremely narrow parts, the smallest measuring only 38 by 72 centimetres (15\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a028\u00a0in).[77][78][79]The journey through the cave to the team took six hours against the current and five hours to exit with the current,[80] even for experienced divers.[81]  Pumps used to drain water from the cave and downstream lakesFrom the outset rescue workers battled rising water levels. In an effort to de-water the cave, a stone diversion dam was built upstream and systems were installed to pump water out of the cave and divert flows that were entering it. On 4 July, it was estimated that the pumps were removing 1,600,000\u00a0l/h (420,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal/h) from the cave, ruining nearby farm fields in the process.[82][83] For a time, well-meaning volunteers inadvertently pumped water back into the groundwater supply.[84] Helped by a spell of unseasonably dry weather, these efforts reduced water levels by 1.5 centimetres (0.6\u00a0in) per hour on 5 July, enabling rescue teams to walk 1.5 kilometres (0.93\u00a0mi) into the cave. However, heavy rains  forecast for 8 July were expected  to halt or reverse this process and could even flood the position where the team were trapped.[85]On 6 July, the oxygen level in the cave was detected to have dropped, raising fears that the boys might develop hypoxia if they remained for a prolonged time. By 8 July the oxygen level was measured to be 15%; the level needed to maintain normal function for humans is between 19.5% and 23.5%.[86] Thai military engineers attempted to install an air supply line to the boys, but the effort was abandoned as impractical.[51]Options[edit]  Thai rescue workers at cave entrance positioning a pipe for water pumping on 2 JulyAs the crisis unfolded, rescuers planned several different methods to save the team and coach. The principal options were to:[87][88][89][81]Wait until the end of the monsoon season; with divers providing food and water.Teach the group basic diving skills.Find an alternative entrance to the cave which could allow for an easier escape; one shaft was discovered that went down 900 metres.[90]Drill a rescue shaft; more than 100 shafts were bored into the soft limestone, but no suitable location was found.[79][75]Build an oxygen line.Build a telephone wire to communicate.The diving option[edit]Multiple dangers\u2014the threat of more heavy rain, dropping oxygen levels, and the difficulty or impossibility of finding or drilling an escape passage\u2014forced rescuers to make the decision to bring out the team and coach with experienced divers.[51][91] The Thai Navy SEALs and US Air Force rescue experts met with the Thai Minister of the Interior who approved the plan.[51][92] Ninety divers worked in the cave system, forty from Thailand and fifty from other countries.[93] Rescuers at first considered teaching the boys basic diving skills to enable them to make the journey.[79][94] Organisers built a mock-up of a tight passage with chairs, and divers practiced with local boys in a school swimming pool. Thai SEALs and US Air Force experts then refined the plan to use teams of divers to bring out the weakened boys.[92]Death of rescue diver[edit]  Saman KunanOn 5 July at 8.37pm, Saman Kunan (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e32\u0e19 \u0e01\u0e38\u0e19\u0e31\u0e19), a 37-year-old[95]  former Thai Navy SEAL, made a dive from Chamber 3 to the T Junction close to Pattaya Beach to deliver three air tanks.[96][97] During his return he lost consciousness underwater. His dive buddy attempted CPR without success. Kunan was brought to Chamber 3 where CPR was attempted again, but he could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead about 1 am on 6 July.[96][98]A member of Thai Navy SEALs class 30, Kunan had left the SEALs in 2006 at the rank of Petty Officer 1st class and was working in security at the Suvarnabhumi Airport when he volunteered to assist the cave rescue.[98][96] He was posthumously promoted to Lieutenant Commander by the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy, an unprecedented rise of seven ranks.[99][100] A funeral sponsored and attended by the Thai royal family was held on 14 July. On the same day, he was also awarded the Knight Grand Cross (first class) of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant by King Vajiralongkorn.[100] A  memorial statue of him may form a part of a proposed tourist attraction at the site.[101][102]Rescue[edit]On the morning of 8 July, officials instructed the media and all non-essential personnel around the cave entrance to clear the area as a rescue operation was imminent, due to the threat of monsoon rains later in the week, which were expected to flood the cave until October.\nFor the first part of the extraction, eighteen rescue divers consisting of thirteen international cave divers and five Thai Navy SEALs were sent into the caves to retrieve the boys, with one diver to accompany each boy on the dive out.[51][103][104][105] There were conflicting reports that the boys were rescued with the weakest first or strongest first. In fact, the order was which boy volunteered first.[14] The international cave diving team was led by four British divers John Volanthen, Richard Stanton, Jason Mallinson, Chris Jewell each assigned a boy and two Australians, Dr Richard Harris, a physician specializing in anesthesia, and Craig Challen.[45][51][106] Their portion of the journey would stretch over 1 kilometre going through submerged routes while being supported by 90 Thai and foreign divers at various points performing medical check-ups, resupplying air-tanks for the main divers and other emergency roles.[107]The boys were dressed in a wetsuit, buoyancy jacket, harness and a positive pressure full face mask. A cylinder with 80% oxygen was clipped to their front, a handle attached to their back and they were tethered to a diver in case they were lost in the poor visibility. The rescue divers described them as \"a package.\"[108][51][109][110] Dr Harris administered anaesthetic to the boys before the journey, rendering them unconscious, to prevent them from panicking on the journey and risking the lives of their rescuers.[111][94] The Thai government provided doctor Harris and two medical assistants with diplomatic immunity if something went wrong.[112][113][114][108] The anaesthetic lasted between 45 minutes to an hour, requiring divers, whom Dr Harris had trained, to re-sedate the boys during the three hour journey.[115][51] The boys were manoeuvred out by the swimming divers who held onto their back or chest, with each boy on either the right or left side of the diver, depending on the guideline; in very narrow spots divers pushed the boys from behind.[51][109] The divers navigated them through tight passages carefully to avoid dislodging their full face mask against rocks. The divers kept their heads higher than the boys so that in poor visibility the diver would hit their head against the rocks first.[51] After a short dive to a dry section, the divers and boys were met by three divers, and the boys' dive gear was removed. The boys were then transported on a drag stretcher over 200\u00a0m of rocks and sand hills. Craig Challen assessed them, and their dive gear was put back on before they were re-submerged for the next section.[51] The boys arrived at 45 minute intervals.[116] The divers knew the boys were breathing from their exhaust bubbles, which they could see and feel.[108]After being delivered by the divers into the staging base in Chamber 3, the boys were then passed along a 'daisy chain' by hundreds of rescuers stationed along the treacherous path out of the cave.[117] The boys, wrapped in 'sked' stretchers, would alternately be carried, slid and zip-lined over a complex network of pulleys installed by rock-climbers.[118] Many areas from Chamber 3 to the entrance of the cave were still partially submerged and rescuers described having to transport the boys over slippery rocks and through muddy water for hours.[119] The journey from Chamber 3 to the cave entrance took about four to five hours initially, but was reduced to less than an hour after a week of draining and clearing the mud path using shovels.[117]The authorities warned that extracting everyone would take several days, because crews had to replace air tanks, gear, and other supplies, requiring ten to twenty hours between each run.[120][121][122] Shortly after 19:00, local officials said that two boys had been rescued and taken to Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital.[123][124][125] Shortly after, two more boys exited the cave and were assessed by medical officials.[123] Low water levels had reduced the time required for the rescues.[126] The lower water was due to improved weather and the construction of a weir outside the cave to help control the water.[127]On 9 July, four more boys were rescued from the cave.[128] On 10 July, the last four boys and their coach were rescued from the cave.[129][3][4][5][130] Experience helped streamline the rescue procedure, so the total time to extract a boy was reduced from three hours on the first day to just over two hours on the final day, allowing four boys and the coach to be rescued.[116][105] The three Thai Navy SEALs and the Army doctor who had stayed with the boys the entire time were the last to dive out. Three of these divers made it to Chamber 3, joining waiting rescuers when the pumps shut off for an uncertain reason, possibly due to a burst water pipe.[131][132] Water levels in Chamber 3 started to rise, which would have cut off rescuers' access to Chamber 2, Chamber 1 and the entrance of the cave.[131] \"All of a sudden a water pipe burst and the main pump stopped working\", a diver stated. \"We really had to run from the third chamber to the entrance because the water level was rising very quickly\u00a0\u2013 like 50\u00a0cm every 10 minutes.\"[132] This forced up to 100 rescuers still located more than 1.5 kilometres (0.93\u00a0mi) inside the cave to evacuate in a hurry, abandoning the rescue equipment inside the cave.[133] The last diver made it back to Chamber 3 as everyone was preparing to leave.[131] The rescuers managed to rush to the cave exit in under an hour.[133]A number of news outlets reported on the role of coach Ekkaphon during the rescue. The coach had previously been a Buddhist monk, and had guided meditation for the children during the ordeal. He also passed on a message in which he apologised for putting the children in danger.[134][135]Recovery[edit]Thai authorities said the rescued boys were able to eat rice porridge, but more complex foods would be withheld for ten days.[136] The Thai Health Ministry said the boys lost an average of 2 kilograms (4.4\u00a0lb) each, but were in \"good condition\".[137] The boys were quarantined while health workers determined whether they had caught any infectious diseases, and they were expected to remain hospitalised for at least one week.[138] Due to the prolonged stay in the damp cave environment, officials were worried about potential infections such as histoplasmosis or leptospirosis.[139] Parents of the team members initially visited looking through a window, but if laboratory results proved negative, they would be allowed to visit in person while wearing a medical gown, face mask and hair cap.[140]The boys wore sunglasses as a precaution while their eyes adjusted to daylight. Detailed tests of their eyes, nutrition, mental health and blood were carried out. A Health Ministry physician said all the boys showed an increase in white blood cells, so preventive antibiotic doses were given to the entire team.[140]Responses[edit]Local[edit]Residents of Chiang Rai province volunteered to cook, clean for, and otherwise support the missing team's families and the rescue teams at the encampment by the cave mouth.[11] Social media were used to draw attention to the rescue attempts.[11] Classmates and teachers of the team spent time chanting and praying for the missing boys.[141] Classmates of one of the boys made 1,000 paper cranes for him, while praying for his safe return.[142] Local schools donated money to help the parents with living costs, as many of them stopped working in order to follow the rescue attempts.[72]On 29 June, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha visited the search site and told the families of the boys not to give up hope.[143] Following the death of Saman Kunan, King Rama X announced that he would sponsor Kunan's funeral.[144]After the rescue was completed, the boys' families, the rescue commander, military officials, and the thousands of volunteers gathered at the cave entrance. The group gave thanks for the lives saved and asked forgiveness from the cave goddess \"Jao Mae Tham\" for the intrusion of pumps, ropes and people during the rescue.[145]Opinions about assistant coach[edit]Some observers, primarily in Western media, questioned whether assistant coach Ekkaphon Chanthawong should face criminal charges for leading the group into the caves, despite the warning sign at the entrance stating that it is dangerous to enter between July and November.[146] The boys had entered the cave on 23 June, one week before the advised period. Local communities, as well as the boys' parents, emphasised that they did not blame the boys or their coach, as the rain had arrived a month earlier than usual.[147] Vern Unsworth, a British caver mapping the cave, stated, \"Nobody\u2019s to blame, not the coach, not the boys. They were just very unlucky ... It wasn\u2019t just the rain that day, the mountain is like a sponge and waters from earlier rain were raising the levels\". Unsworth said that he himself had been planning to make a solo venture into the complex on 24 June, when he received a telephone call saying the boys were missing there.[148]While the police chief told the newspaper Khao Sod that he \"hadn't ruled out\" pressing negligence charges against the coach for putting the team in danger, no calls were made to take legal action against him. A number of lawyers stated that the coach would probably not face criminal charges, since Thai law also takes into consideration whether a person has malicious intent. In mainstream media, Ekkaphon has widely been held 'a hero' and was a \"calm voice [that] helped boys to beat despair in the darkness.\"[149][150][151] The coach was reported to have treated the boys with care, giving them his food, helping them remain calm, and instructing them to drink the relatively clean water dripping from the cave walls, instead of the murky floodwaters that trapped them.\nWhen asked if Ekkaphon should be held legally responsible for negligence, Mongkhon Bunpiam, the father of 12-year-old Mongkhon, rejected the suggestion: \u201cWe would never do that...the boys love their coach...and we as parents don\u2019t want it either. Coach Ekk has been good to my boy, and now I hear how he gave them hope, and kept them calm for so many days without food. I have great admiration for him.\u201d[149] Tanawut Vibulrungruang, father of 11-year old Chanin, was reported to be \"touched by the actions of the team's coach. Without him...he doesn't know how the kids could have survived.\"[152] The team's head coach, Nopparat Kanthawong, said he would not have approved of the hike, but was confident in Ekkaphon's ability to take care of the boys. Prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the emphasis should be on the rescue and the recovery of the team, and he asked the public to avoid a rush to judgment.[153][154][155]International[edit]Over the course of two weeks, hundreds of volunteers, military specialists and corporate experts arrived from around the world to offer assistance in the rescue.\nAustralia: Six Australian Federal Police (AFP) Specialist Response Group divers, one NavyClearance diver, one Australian Medical Assistance Team (AUSMAT) member and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Crisis Response Team officers. Up to 20 Australians were involved at the cave site.[156][157] Doctor Richard Harris, an anaesthetist, was part of the medical team that determined the boys' fitness to make the 4-kilometre (2.5\u00a0mi) journey. Harris and his diving partner, retired veterinarian Doctor Craig Challen, both cave diving specialists, played key roles in the rescue. The Thai government provided Harris with diplomatic immunity to protect him in case anything went wrong with the sedation.[51][112]Belgium: Ben Reymenants, the owner of a diving school in Phuket, contributed in cave diving capacity.[158]Canada: Erik Brown, a dive instructor from Vancouver, participated on the cave diving team.[159]China: A six man team from the volunteer rescue organisation the Beijing Peaceland Foundation arrived on 29 June.[40] The team brought rescue equipment including an underwater robot, diving equipment and a three-dimensional imager.[158] A second Chinese team arrived on 30 June from the Green Boat Emergency Rescue organisation with expertise in search and rescue on mountains and in caves.[160]Czech Republic: Government of the Czech Republic offered to provide a Czech manufacturer's high performance pumps; the state has four such pumps, each with an output of 400 litres per second (1,440,000 l/h (380,000 US gal/h)).[161] Upon inspection at the site, however, it was determined heavy-duty pumps could not be used due to unsuitable terrain.[162]Denmark: Two Danish divers, Ivan Karadzic who runs a diving center with Finnish Mikko Paasi, and Claus Rasmussen, a diving instructor, participated in the cave diving team.[159]Finland: Diver Mikko Paasi came to assist with rescue efforts.[163]France: Diver Maksym Polejaka assisted with the rescue efforts.[164][165]Ireland: Diver Jim Warny assisted with the rescue efforts.[166]India: Experts from Kirlosker Brothers' Limited's (KBL) offered technical know-how and advice on dewatering and pumps.[167]Israel: Diver Rafael Aroush joined the diving team while emergency mobile communication devices were donated by Maxtech NetWorks.[168]Japan: Divers and engineers, including Shigeki Miyake, a drainage specialist of the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Thailand, assisted in efforts to pump water out of the cave.[169]Laos: Members of the Vientiane Rescue contributed to search and rescue efforts.[170][171][172]Netherlands: Drainage specialists were sent to aid water pumping efforts.[173]Russia: Ministry of Emergency Situations  ready to sent a volunteer team[174] including a rescue specialist.[175][176]Ukraine: Divers Vsevolod Korobov and Maksym Polejaka came to assist with rescue efforts.[177]United Kingdom: The British Cave Rescue Council sent eight experienced cave rescue divers, some familiar with caves in Thailand, to lead the diving team; three cave rescue personnel; and special equipment.[106][178][179][180] Vernon Unsworth, a British man living in the area, was the first person with caving expertise on the site.[181] John Volanthen and Rick Stanton discovered the boys and led the cave diving team.[182][183][184][185][186] Chris Jewell and Jason Mallison brought 500 kilograms (1,100\u00a0lb) of diving equipment.[187][181] Other divers involved included Connor Roe and Josh Bratchley. Other cave rescue personnel, Mike Clayton, and Gary Mitchell provided surface control for the divers, along with Robert Harper who had initially deployed among the first three U.K. divers.[188][54] Tim Acton deployed as a friend of the Thai Navy SEAL's.[189]United States: On 28 June, the US military\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) deployed 36 personnel from Okinawa, including airmen from 353rd Special Operations Group and the 31st Rescue Squadron. According to Military.com, they joined seven other personnel, including a member of Joint US Military Advisory Group Thailand. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Rob Manning said that US personnel had \"staged equipment and prepared the first three chambers of the cave for safe passage. The US contingent assisted in transporting the evacuees through the final chambers of the system, and provided medical personnel and other technical assistance to the rescue efforts.\"[190]Volunteers, teams and technical specialists from countries including Germany,[191] Myanmar,[53] the Philippines,[192] Singapore,[193] Spain,[194] Sweden,[195] and Ukraine,[196] also participated in the operation. France offered to send a team of specialists and equipment, but Thai authorities believed that adequate resources were already on site.[197]The ordeal captured the media's attention from around the world. Over a period of three weeks, articles relating to the incident dominated the top stories section at many major news publications.[198]Tesla chief executive Elon Musk contacted James Yenbamroong, CEO of Thailand-based satellite company mu Space Corp, to get him connected with the Thai government.[199] He then ordered engineers from two of his companies to design a \"kid-sized\" submarine to help the rescue effort.[200][201] Thai authorities decided not to use the submarine.[202][203]Sports world[edit]FIFA, via a letter from its president Gianni Infantino to the president of the Football Association of Thailand, invited the children and coach to the World Cup final if circumstances allowed.[204] The entire team was expected to remain hospitalised for at least a week, and watched the final on television instead.[205]  FC Barcelona invited the team to play in their international academy tournament in 2019 and to watch a first-team game at their home stadium Camp Nou.[206]England and Manchester City F.C. defender Kyle Walker said he wanted to send them shirts, after spotting that one of the rescued boys was wearing a \"Three Lions\" jersey.[207] In October 2018 the boys traveled to the UK as guests at Old Trafford for the Manchester United F.C. home match against Everton F.C. in the Premier League.[208][209] The boys were invited by the IOC to the opening ceremony of the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires.[210]Timeline[edit]  International cave divers prepare their diving gear on 2 July23 June: The team entered the Tham Luang cave shortly after practice and prior to heavy rain. Later, the mother of one of the boys reported to local police that her son was missing after he failed to arrive home. Local police investigated and found shoes and bicycles near the entrance of the cave after rumors spread about them going into the Tham Luang cave.[211]24 June: Handprints and footprints of the boys were found by officials. A vigil is held outside the cave by relatives.[211]25 June: Thai Navy SEAL divers enter the cave to search for the team.[211]26 June: Having arrived at a T-junction, divers were pushed back due to floodwaters. The floodwaters blocked an elevated air pocket near Pattaya Beach, where divers believe the team may have been stranded.[211]27 June: British and a US military team of divers and experts were sent to Thailand to help with the search. Divers re-entered but quickly retreated due to another flooding.[211][212]28 June: Heavy rains caused the rescue operation to stop temporarily. In order to drain the water, pumps were delivered. Drones were dispatched to assist more than 600 people in search of new vents in the cave roof.[211][212]29 June: Thai Prime MinisterPrayut Chan-o-cha visited the site.[211]30 June: The search resumed after divers took advantage of a brief pause in the rainfall. They advanced further, but still were far from where they believed the boys might be stranded.[211]1 July: As divers went deeper into the cave, they used Chamber 3 as an operating base to store diving cylinders and other supplies which were replenished by support divers transiting back and forth to the entrance.[211]2 July: The team were found alive on elevated land in the evening at around 20:20[53] by the British diving team, including Richard Stanton and John Volanthen, 400\u00a0m (1,300\u00a0ft) further than Pattaya Beach. Communication was difficult since only Adun spoke English.[211]3 July: Seven Thai Navy divers, including Doctor Pak Loharnshoon and a medic, went to deliver food, medicine and supplies to the boys, including high calorie gels and paracetamol.[211] Four of them, including Loharnshoon, volunteered to stay with the boys inside the cave for a week until all 12 were extracted.[213] They would be the last people to exit the cave.[214]4 July: The team were taught how to use a full face diving mask and breathing apparatus as none of the boys knew how to swim. Rescue teams worked on continuing to pumping water from the cave, they had already pumped out over 30 million gallons.[211]5 July: The rescue was forced to move more quickly due to expected rain. Another group searched the mountains for any new cracks or openings.[211]6 July: Saman Kunan, a former Thai navy diver and volunteer of the rescue mission, died between 01:00 to 02:00 after losing consciousness while placing diving cylinders underwater along the route to the stranded boys.[215] Authorities urged that the rescue happen faster, due to oxygen levels falling to 15%, well below the 21% \"safe zone.\" \n7 July: The rescue chief claimed that it was not suitable for the team to dive yet. More than 100 vents were being drilled in a third attempt to reach the team. However, an accident to a rescue vehicle injured six people, and the effort was called off.[citation needed] A letter appeared from the coach of the team, apologising to the boys' parents along with letters from the boys to their parents.[18][211]8 July: Thirteen international divers, led by four British and two Australian divers,[106] and five Thai military SEALs divers went into the cave to begin bringing the boys to safety.[216][104] The boys were each to be accompanied by 3 divers as they made their way out of the cave. The boys were also sedated to prevent any panic. The first boy was reported to have come out about 17:40, and the fourth one was reported to have exited about 19:50,[217] though not all sources agree. The four boys were taken to Chiang Rai Prachanukroh, a local hospital. It was announced that divers would not resume the rescue for at least another 10 hours, as they needed to replenish supplies.[211]9 July: Four more boys were confirmed to be out of the cave and then taken to the hospital. It was also announced that the boys would be kept in quarantine.[218]10 July: The remaining four boys and their coach were rescued.[219][3][4][5] It was later confirmed that all of the rescue divers had also successfully exited the cave.[219][220]Legacy[edit]  The Wild Boars with Thomas Bach at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics.The head of the rescue mission and former governor of Chiang Rai province, Narongsak Osatanakorn\u00a0[th], said that the cave system would be turned into a living museum to highlight how the operation unfolded. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha acknowledged the statement but highlighted the concerns for tourist safety, stating that precautions would have to be added and correctly implemented both inside and outside to safeguard tourists.[221][222][223]Following the incident, Thailand's Navy SEALs will include cave-diving in their training regimen to be better prepared for similar emergencies.[224]Three of the boys and their assistant coach were stateless, and officials promised that they would be granted Thai citizenship within six months.[30] On 26 September, the four were granted Thai citizenship.[31] The Thai government has vowed to end statelessness by 2024.[225]Possible film[edit]On 10 July, a managing partner of US film production company Pure Flix announced that the firm was planning to create a feature film based on the rescue, with potential for worldwide release.[226] Ivanhoe Pictures of SK Global Entertainment also expressed interest in a separate project, with Jon Chu slated as the director.[227] A film, called The Cave, is currently being filmed by Thai-Irish filmmaker Tom Waller, featuring many of the real-life cave divers as themselves.[228]Awards[edit]Australia: On 24 July 2018, the Governor-General of Australia awarded the Bravery Medal to the six AFP Special Response Group divers and the Navy Clearance diver who supported the diving operation in the cave for having \"displayed considerable bravery\". Cave divers Doctor Richard Harris and Craig Challen were awarded the Star of Courage for \"displayed conspicuous courage\". All nine were awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) \"for service to the international community through their specialist response roles\".[229] On 25 January 2019, Challen and Harris were named Australians of the Year.[230]China: On 18 July 2018, the Thai Ambassador to Beijing hosted a luncheon for the Beijing Peaceland Foundation and Green Boat Emergency Rescue organisation.[231]Thailand:\nOn 13 July 2018, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy (C-in-C), in a letter of commendation, posthumously promoted to lieutenant commander former Navy SEAL Saman Kunan, who had died on 6 July, and on 14 July the King of Thailand awarded him with the Knight Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant.[99][100] Commander of the Navy SEALs, Rear Admiral Apakorn Youkongkaew, and Navy SEAL Special Captain Anan Surawan, Commander of the First Special Warfare Corps, were cited in the letter of commendation by the C-in-C for their \"outstanding performance, which sets the best example for others in the Thai navy to follow\".[232][99] RADM Youkongkaew had commanded the overall activities of all divers during the operation and CAPT Surawan had commanded the operational center in Chamber 3.[232] The commendation stated that 127 current and former Navy SEAL members and a 32 member medical team had participated in the rescue.[99]On 7 September 2018 the Royal Thai government hosted a reception for all Thai and foreign officials and personnel involved in the rescue. His Majesty the King granted a royal decoration, The Most Admirable Order of the Direkgunabhorn, to 188 people who were involved in the rescue of the football team\u2014114 foreigners and 74 Thais.[233] The Royal Thai Government Gazette has officially published the list of recipients of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn for Tham Luang cave rescue on 21 March 2019.[234]United Kingdom:\nOn 24 July 2018, the Prime Minister hosted a reception at 10 Downing Street with the Thai Ambassador for the British Cave Rescue Council divers and personnel involved in the rescue.[235][236]In November 2018, the British cave rescue team were given the Pride of Britain 2018 award for \"Outstanding Bravery\". The rescued children attended the award ceremony, in London.[237]On 28 December 2018 seven British members of the rescue team were honoured in the 2019 New Year Honours. Stanton and Volanthen each received the George Medal; Jewell and Mallinson received the Queen's Gallantry Medal; and Josh Bratchley, Connor Roe and Vern Unsworth were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire.[238][239]Stanton, Volanthen, Harris, Mallinson and Jewell were the first ever recipients of the Medal of Valor from the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, an American organisation.[240]On 5 January 2019, the Asian Football Federation  awarded the Wild Boars a two-year support program, which will provide the club with technical support and training equipment and 100 Molten match balls a year.

It is also the 16th season for the franchise in Connecticut. The season tipped off on May 13.[1]The Sun got off to a strong start, going 3\u20130 in May.  All three wins were at home.  In June, the Sun started strong, winning their first 4 of 5.  However, they lost 5 of their next 7 games to finish 6\u20136 on the month.  That skid included a 1\u20134 road trip, where all losses came 4 of eventual top 5 playoff teams.  Their up and down season continued into July, where the Sun were 5\u20136.  July started with another tough road trip where the Sun went 1\u20133.  From there the Sun couldn't get a streak going; losing 2 then winning 2 then losing 2 again.  The Sun surged in August posting a 7\u20131 record, including going 6\u20130 at home.  Their only loss came on the road to Chicago.  The Sun finished 21\u201313, which earned them the 4th seed in the 2018 WNBA Playoffs.  Their playoff run fell short when they lost at home in the second round 86\u201396.  This was the Sun's only playoff game, as they earned a first round bye.\nContents1Transactions1.1WNBA Draft1.2Trades/Roster Changes2Current roster3Game Log3.1Pre-Season3.2Regular Season3.3Playoffs4Standings5Awards and honors6Statistics6.1Regular season7References8External links\n\nTransactions[edit]WNBA Draft[edit]See also: 2018 WNBA DraftRound\nPick\nPlayer\nNationality\nSchool/Team/Country\n1\n9\nLexie Brown\u00a0United StatesDuke3\n33\nMikayla Cowling\u00a0United StatesCaliforniaTrades/Roster Changes[edit]Date\nDetails\nFebruary 2, 2018\nAcquired C Cayla George via trade from the Phoenix Mercury in exchange for 21st pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft.[2]February 7, 2018\nSigned G Leticia Romero[3]April 12, 2018\nSun receive Bria Holmes in exchange for 15th pick in 2018 WNBA Draft and a second round pick in 2019 WNBA draft.[4]July 9, 2018\nSun receive Layshia Clarendon and a second round pick in 2019 WNBA draft in exchange for Alex Bentley.[5]Current roster[edit]\n\nConnecticut Sun rostervtePlayersCoaches\nPos.#Nat.NameHeightWeightDOBFromYrs\n\n\nG1\nBanham, Rachel5' 9\" (1.75m)\n168 lb (76kg)\n07-15-1993\nMinnesota2\n\nG4\nBrown, Lexie5' 9\" (1.75m)\n\u2013\n10-27-1994\nDukeR\n\nG23\nClarendon, Layshia5' 9\" (1.75m)\n158 lb (72kg)\n05-02-1991\nCalifornia5\n\nG32\nHolmes, Bria6' 1\" (1.85m)\n170 lb (77kg)\n04-19-1994\nWest Virginia2\n\nF35\nJones, Jonquel6' 6\" (1.98m)\n190 lb (86kg)\n01-05-1994\nGeorge Washington2\n\nC42\nJones, Brionna6' 3\" (1.91m)\n230 lb (104kg)\n12-18-1995\nMaryland1\n\nG/F44\nLaney, Betnijah6' 0\" (1.83m)\n160 lb (73kg)\n10-29-1993\nRutgers2\n\nF13\nOgwumike, Chiney6' 4\" (1.93m)\n173 lb (78kg)\n03-22-1992\nStanford2\n\nG/F40\nStricklen, Shekinna6' 2\" (1.88m)\n178 lb (81kg)\n07-30-1990\nTennessee6\n\nF25\nThomas, Alyssa6' 2\" (1.88m)\n185 lb (84kg)\n04-12-1992\nMaryland4\n\nG5\nThomas, Jasmine5' 9\" (1.75m)\n145 lb (66kg)\n09-30-1989\nDuke7\n\nF33\nTuck, Morgan6' 2\" (1.88m)\n200 lb (91kg)\n04-30-1994\nConnecticut2\n\nG10\nWilliams, Courtney5' 8\" (1.73m)\n136 lb (62kg)\n05-11-1994\nSouth Florida2\n\nEast: ATL \u2022 CHI \u2022 CON \u2022 IND \u2022 NY \u2022 WAS  |  West: DAL \u2022 LV \u2022 LA \u2022 MIN \u2022 PHO \u2022 SEAHead coachCurt Miller (Baldwin Wallace)Assistant coaches Brandi Poole  Steve SmithLegend(C) Team captain(DP) Unsigned draft pick(FA) Free agent(S) Suspended InjuredWNBA roster page  Game Log[edit]Pre-Season[edit]\n\n2018 pre-season game log\n\n\n\n\nMay: 3\u20130 (Home: 3\u20130; Road: 0\u20130)\n\nGameDateTeamScoreHigh pointsHigh reboundsHigh assistsLocationAttendanceRecord\n1\nMay 7\nLos AngelesW 68\u201365J.

It was discovered by Brett J. Gladman in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000\u00a0S\u00a05.[6][7] It was named after Kiviuq, a hero of Inuit mythology.[8] \nKiviuq is about 16 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 11.1 million kilometers in 450 days. It is a member of the Inuit group of irregular satellites. It is light red, and the Kiviupian (Kiviuqan) infrared spectrum is very similar to the Inuit-group satellites Siarnaq and Paaliaq, supporting the thesis of a possible common origin of the Inuit group in the break-up of a larger body.[5][9]Kiviuq is believed to be in Kozai resonance, cyclically reducing its orbital inclination while increasing the eccentricity and vice versa.[10]Exploration[edit]On 30 August 2010, the ISS camera of the Cassini\u2013Huygens spacecraft took light-curve data from a distance of 9.3 million km. With these data, the rotation period was measured to 21 hours and 49 minutes.[3]References[edit]^Discovery Circumstances (JPL)^ abScott Sheppard pages^ abT. Denk, S. Mottola, et al.

The society's purpose is to encourage and foster the attainment of knowledge in the natural and computer sciences and mathematics.[1]Contents1History2Activities3Qualifications for Membership4Chapters5References6External links\n\nHistory[edit]Sigma Zeta was founded in the fall of 1925 at the now defunct Shurtleff College as a local organization to provide recognition for Shurtleff science and mathematics students. Soon after that other local campuses took an interest in the group, and following the approval of the petition by McKendree College to start a chapter in June 1926 Sigma Zeta began its growth into a national collegiate honor society.[2] In a letter that appeared in the correspondence section of the American Chemical SocietyJournal of Chemical Education Sigma Zeta was offered as an alternative for small colleges to the existing Sigma Xi honor society which often passed over small colleges for membership as they focused on larger Universities.[3]Sigma Zeta's annual convention has been held every year since 1926 except for 1943, 1944, and 1945 where it was canceled due to World War II.[4] The first three gatherings were held at the Shurtleff College campus which is now the site of the Southern Illinois University School of Dental Medicine.\nActivities[edit]The annual convention is Sigma Zeta's primary meeting where student members present papers and individual and chapter awards are presented.[5][6][7] Individual chapters often undertake activities including the hosting of speakers and service projects to benefit their local communities.[8] These activities can include programs for younger students at local schools helping to promote science education at early ages.[9][10] Sigma Zeta's interdisciplinary nature has been described as a benefit for smaller colleges and universities because, \"It brings together students from all areas of science and mathematics, including computer science, so they can all work together on projects.\"[11]Qualifications for Membership[edit]Chapters select students for membership that have met the following eligibility criteria:\nMajor studies in at least one of the Natural Sciences, Computer Science, or MathematicsCompletion of 25 semester hours of coursework with 15 hours in the Natural Sciences, Computer Science, or MathematicsA Grade Point Average of 3.0 out of 4.0 both in Science and Mathematics as well as cumulatively among all classes taken[12]Chapters[edit]Chapters in existence are listed in the order they joined Sigma Zeta.[13]Beta, McKendree University, 1926Gamma, Medical College of Virginia, 1927Epsilon, Otterbein College, 1929Lambda, Mansfield University, 1936Mu, Minnesota State University, Mankato,  1937Xi, Ball State University, 1938Pi, Millikin University, 1943Rho, University of Indianapolis, 1943Sigma, Our Lady of the Lake University, 1944Tau, East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, 1947Upsilon, Anderson University, 1948Phi, Eureka College, 1948Chi, Missouri Valley College, 1951Psi, Central Missouri State University, 1956Alpha Beta, Campbellsville University, 1963Alpha Gamma, Malone College, 1969Alpha Delta, Kansas Newman College, 1969Alpha Epsilon, Indiana Wesleyan University, 1969Alpha Zeta, Indiana State University, 1969Alpha Eta, Olivet College, 1969Alpha Theta, Asbury College, 1970Alpha Kappa, University of Southern Indiana, 1970Alpha Lambda, Suffolk University, 1970Alpha Mu, Immaculata College, 1971Alpha Nu, Oglethorpe University, 1971Alpha Xi, University of Virginia's College at Wise, 1971Alpha Pi, Trevecca Nazarene College, 1972Alpha Rho, Stonehill College, 1972Alpha Sigma, Dakota Wesleyan University, 1972Alpha Upsilon, Union University, 1975Alpha Phi, Marist College, 1975Alpha Chi, Eastern College, 1976Alpha Psi, Hillsdale College, 1976Alpha Omega, St. Mary of the Woods College, 1976Beta Alpha, Lyndon State College, 1977Beta Beta, George Fox University, 1978Beta Gamma, Columbia College, 1978Beta Epsilon, Arcadia University, 1979Beta Zeta, Cabrini College, 1981Beta Iota, Bethel University, 1983Beta Theta, Belhaven College, 1983Beta Eta, Evangel College, 1985Beta Kappa Kentucky Wesleyan College, 1991Beta Lambda, Messiah College, 1993Beta Mu, Coastal Carolina University, 1994Beta Delta, Gwynedd Mercy College, 1996Somerset Associate Chapter, Somerset Community College, 1997*Beta Nu, Houghton College, 1997Beta XI (1999) -

The company is the world's second largest producer of manganese ore.\nAt first the ore was carried by a cableway to the border with the Republic of the Congo, then by rail to the sea at Pointe-Noire.\nIn the 1980s a railway was built to carry the ore through Gabon to the sea near Libreville.\nContents1Ore deposits2Initial development3Trans-Gabon railway and port4Development at Moanda5Volumes6Ownership and management7Notes8Sources\n\nOre deposits[edit]FrancevilleMoandaMbindaMakabanaMonto BelloPointe-NoireLocations in Gabon / Congo RepublicManganese was first reported in the Franceville region in 1895.\nFurther discoveries were made in 1934, 1944 and 1945.\nSystematic exploration began in 1951.[1]\nIn 1951 a joint mission of the Bureau Minier de la France d'Outre-Mer and U.S. Steel found a large deposit estimated at over 100 million tonnes of marketable ore.[2]\nThe ore is high quality with a manganese content of 45\u201350%.[3]The deposits are found in five plateaus around Moanda in the Haut-Ogoou\u00e9 Province and were formed by supergene enrichment of Precambrian sediments. \nThe Bangombe plateau has a 19 square kilometres (7.3\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) mineralized area, and was the first to be exploited.\nThe Okuama plateau has a 13 square kilometres (5.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) mineralized area. \nThere are smaller deposits in the Bafoula, Massengo and Yeye plateaus.[4]The lowest level of the ore zone is a 0.1 to 0.5 metres (3.9\u00a0in to 1\u00a0ft 7.7\u00a0in) layer of massive manganese oxides and hydroxides with some manganese carbonate (rhodochrosite).\nAbove this is the main ore zone, a 3 to 9 metres (9.8 to 29.5\u00a0ft) layer of plates of similar minerals between bands of clay, silica and iron bearing material.\nThe main manganese minerals are pyrolusite, manganite, polianite, nsutite and psilomelane. \nRamsdellite, hausmannite and cryptomelane are also found. \nAbove the main ore zone is a 5 to 6 metres (16 to 20\u00a0ft) layer rich in alumina and iron-rich manganiferous pisolites, with a manganese content of 15%.[4]Initial development[edit]MoandaLibreville/OwendoNdjol\u00e9France-villeLocations in GabonCOMILOG was established on 24 April 1953 to mine a deposit estimated at 50 million tons of manganese ore in Gabon, with US Steel owning almost half the company.[5]\nThe ore deposit was over 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) from the sea, separated from it by rugged mountainous terrain.\nThe solution was to carry the ore by cableway from Moanda to Mbinda in the Republic of the Congo, and then by a new railway line via Makabana to Monto Bello.\nFrom there the existing Congo\u2013Ocean Railway  (CFCO: Chemin de Fer Congo-Oc\u00e9an) would link to the port of Pointe-Noire.[2]\nThe 76 kilometres (47\u00a0mi) aerial cableway was the second longest in the world (the longest being  Norsj\u00f6 aerial tramway in Sweden).[6]\n286 kilometres (178\u00a0mi) of track were built between 1959 and 1962 from Mbinda to the CFCO tracks at a location 200 kilometres (120\u00a0mi) from Pointe-Noire.[7]On the cableway the ore bins were spaced along the cable 54 metres (177\u00a0ft) apart.\nThe bins discharged 150 tons of ore per hour into a 25,000 ton storage tank at Mbinda.\nFrom there a conveyor belt carried the ore to railway wagons.\nThe 1,470\u00a0hp locomotives each pulled 40 wagons with 49 tons of load, and could carry from 600,000 to 700,000 tons annually.[2]\nSpace was allocated to COMILOG at the port of Point-Noire for storage and embarkation of the ore.\nThe ore was carried on a network of conveyor belts that routed it to or from a storage facility with about 160,000 tons capacity, or directed it to ships at the rate of 1,000 tons per hour.[2]Henri Lafond, the first president of COMILOG, was responsible for equipping the mine and for building the cableway, railway and facilities for ore handling at Pointe-Noire.\nThe US Steel team participated in this work.[8]\nConstruction of the factories and the COMILOG Cableway were complete in 1959.[9]\nThe first ore was shipped from Moanda on 2 October 1962.[10]\nThe new mine, railway and port provided regular jobs to many people, and opened up land for settlement.[2]\nShipment of COMILOG ores became an important component of the Congoloese economy.[11]Trans-Gabon railway and port[edit]  Ore trucks on the Trans-Gabon RailwayAnnual shipment volumes were at first limited to 2.7 million tons, the capacity of the cableway.[1]\nGabon experienced an economic expansion between 1973 and 1985 based on exports of petroleum, manganese, uranium and timber.\nThe government used some of the proceeds to build the Trans-Gabon Railway between 1974 and 1986.\nIt connected the new port being built at Owendo to Franceville on the upper Ogoou\u00e9 River and opened up the forests and mines of the interior.[12]\nThe only railway line in Gabon, it runs for 640 kilometres (400\u00a0mi) from Libreville to Franceville.[13]The new railway was used to carry ore  from Moanda to the port of Owendo near Libreville.[9]\nIn 1985 six MaK G 1203 BB locomotives with Cummins engines were built by Maschinenbau Kiel for the OCTRA (Office du chemin de fer transgabonais) railway company.[14]\nIn 2003 the tracks were upgraded to increase train frequency, allowing greater volumes of ore shipment.[15]\nIn 2012 the railway carried an estimated 711,201 tons of merchandise and 255,930 passengers.[16]At Owendo COMILOG operates a private ore shipment terminal and storage facilities with capacity for three months' production.[17]\nThe ore shipment port at Owendo was inaugurated in 1988, and the cableway was shut down in 1991.[9]\nThe company laid off 955 workers. The workers claimed compensation for unfair dismissal, but the case dragged out until September 2015, when the Court of Appeal of Paris ordered COMILOG to compensate the workers.[18]\nAfter ore shipments stopped the Republic of the Congo expropriated the track and equipment in their country, worth about 60 billion CFA francs.[11]\nThe COMILOG railway in the DRC was taken over by the CFCO (Chemin de fer Congo-Oc\u00e9an) and is the main means of transport for people and goods north of Niari.[2]\nThe aerial cableway was sold to South Korea and dismantled in 1993.[11]Development at Moanda[edit]  Town of MoandaAs of 2001 the Moanda mine had a capacity of 2.5 million tons of ore per year, with reserves of 100 years.[19]\nThe ore is mined by the open pit technique, using trenches 600 to 900 metres (2,000 to 3,000\u00a0ft) long and 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) wide.\nThe waste, accounting for 50% of material extracted, is backfilled. \nOre beneficiation includes crushing, screening and drum washing.[1]\nAt first COMILOG used blast furnaces in Boulogne and China to produce most of the manganese alloys.\nThis changed in 1999 when Eramet bought the Sauda and Porsgrunn plants in Norway and the Marietta, Ohio plant in the US.\nThe Boulogne plant was later closed.[20]The Complex Industriel de Moanda (CIM) was inaugurated on 30 December 2000 by Omar Bongo, President of Gabon.\nIn January 2001 COMILOG announced the start of construction of the CIM  in partnership with the state of Gabon.[19]\nThe processing unit would let COMILOG export manganese agglomerate for production of ferromanganese, with a capacity of 600,000 tons of agglomerate per year.\nUntil then only crude manganese ore had been exported.\nThe MIC would first enrich and then agglomerate high-grade manganese ore.[19]\nUntil 2007 COMILOG dumped the 0\u20131 millimetre (0.000\u20130.039\u00a0in) fines, and used only the richer 1\u20138 millimetres (0.039\u20130.315\u00a0in) fines to produce sinter.\nIn 2007 Eramet began trials of the feasibility of using part of the lower-grade fines in sintering.[21]In 2009 work began on building the Complexe M\u00e9tallurgique de Moanda (CMM), which would produce silico-manganese[a] and manganese metal.[9]\nConstruction of the CMM was completed in December 2014.[24]\nProduction of silico-manganese began that year.[9]\nOn 12 June 2015 Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of Gabon, officially inaugurated the CMM, the first manganese processing factory in the country. \nThe 50 hectares (120 acres) facility has two plants, one with an annual capacity of 65,000 tons of silico-manganese, and the other with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons of manganese metal.\nConstruction cost about \u20ac228.67, entirely financed by private companies.\nTo support the facility the state of Gabon built the Grand Poubara hydroelectric dam with an existing capacity of 160\u00a0MW and planned capacity of 280\u00a0MW.[24]\nIn 2016 the School of Mines and Metallurgy was opened in Moanda.[9]\nThe school, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, was to train 150 people per year.[25]Volumes[edit]  Wharf at Pointe-NoireIn the first year COMILOG exported 500,000 tons of ore via Point Noire, which soon rose to 1 million tons annually.[2]\nIn 1977 COMILOG shipped 1,859,000 tons or ore, and in 1978 shipped 1,694,416 tons.[1]\nManganese ore production at Moanda, including sinter, grew from 1.95 million tons in 2003 to 2.46 million tons in 2004.\nAs of 2005 most of the sinter produced by COMILOG was shipped to a smelter in France operated by the Eramet subsidiary, SFPO (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Ferromangan\u00e8se de Paris-Outreau).[15]In 2011 the company produced 3.43 million tons of ore and exported 3,383,000 tons of ore and 64,000 tons of manganese alloys.\nAlthough output had risen by 5.8% over 2010, revenue dropped by 17% due to an 18% drop in prices.[26]\nProduction fell to 3 million tonnes in 2012 due to weak demand in China and Europe, the main markets.[27]\nAs of 2013 about 90% of the ore was used for steel production, and half the exports were to China.[3]\n2014 operating income was 90 billion CFA francs, compared to 143 billion CFA francs in 2013.\nThe decline was due to a major railway accident in 2014 and a decline in manganese prices.[24]\nIn 2014 Gabon was the third largest producer of manganese ore in the world, after South Africa and Australia.[28]Ownership and management[edit]  SLN (Eramet) Jules Garnier II bulk carrierThe Compagnie mini\u00e8re de l'Ogoou\u00e9 (COMILOG) was established in 1953 as a joint corporation owned by the Bureau of Mines of Overseas France (21%), Eastern Tjbangi Mining Company (15%), Mokta el Hadid group (15%) and U.S. Steel (49%).[5]\nCOMILOG had initial capital of CFA 150 million.[10]\nThe NickelSLN Metallurgical Company was formed in 1974, with equal shares held by Elf Aquitaine and Im\u00e9tal (formerly Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Le Nickel).\nThere were various changes in ownership over the following years, and the name was changed to Eramet.[29]\nIn 1995\u201396 Eramet acquired a 46% stake in COMILOG.[30]\nCOMILOG acquired a facility at Guangxi, China, in 1995 and at

Both were silicomanganese producers.[31]As of 2001 the company was the second largest producer of manganese ore in the world and had about 4,450 employees.\nCOMILOG was owned 57% by Eramet, 27% by the state of Gabon and 8% by COGEMA.[19]\nIn 2010 the state of Gabon increased its holdings in COMILOG, which was now owned 63.7% by Eramet, 28.9% by Gabon, 7% by Formang Holding and 0.4% by others.\nIn 2011 Marcel Ab\u00e9k\u00e9 was succeeded by Jean Fabre as general manager.[9]\nIn 2013 COMILOG was providing 70% of the funding for the Maboumine rare-earth mineral exploration project.[25]\nIn October 2014 the state holdings were transferred to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9quatoriale des mines, a private company 100% owned by the state.[24]The state's rail company OCTRA (Office du chemin de fer transgabonais) was privatized late in 2004 by a group consisting of Transgabonais, some timber companies, the Belgian rail company Transurb and others.\nCOMILOG led a competing group, but decided not to submit a final bid.[32]\nAs of 2012 COMILOG employed 3,200 people in Gabon, including 1,700 at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019exploitation du Transgabonais (SETRAG), the subsidiary that operates the railway.[26]\nIn 2015 SETRAG took responsibility for maintenance of the railway.\nThat year Jean Fabre was replaced by Herv\u00e9 Mont\u00e9gu.[9]Notes[edit]^Silico-manganese is an alloy of 65\u201368% manganese, 16\u201321% silicon and 1.5\u20132% carbon, produced by smelting at high temperatures.[22]\nIt is used as an additive in the steel industry, as a deoxidant or as input to producing other alloys of manganese.[23]^ abcdNational Materials Advisory Board 1981, p.\u00a0177.^ abcdefgYa Sanza 2006.^ abOxford Business Group 2013, p.\u00a0104.^ abNational Materials Advisory Board 1981, p.\u00a0178.^ abPons 1954, p.\u00a0297.^Clark & Decalo 2012, p.\u00a0109.^Clark & Decalo 2012, pp.\u00a0109\u2013110.^Georges Charles PERRINEAU ...

In 1935, together with Karel \u010condl, \u0160torch wrote a three volumes textbook of history for secondary schools. The textbook was attacked by catholic church because it documented attempts of the church to obtain political power throughout the history.\n\u0160torch published several scholar works, many novels for the youth and countless number of articles in journals and newspapers. The novels were based on and limited by scientific knowledge of the time.

TV appearances have included: Jools Holland's Hootenanny, BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms, Blue Peter, The Slammer, Richard & Judy, This Morning and Skins.\nThe band was formed \"to challenge people\u2019s expectations of the ukulele,\" according to Uke Richie Williams.[6]Repertoire range[edit]A typical UOGB concert comprises songs and instrumentals from a variety of musical genres: regulars include Kate Bush's \"Wuthering Heights\" reworked as a swinging jazz number, Ennio Morricone's theme to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Tchaikovsky's \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\", \"Anarchy in the UK\" performed in the style of Simon and Garfunkel, and the theme tune from Shaft. The Orchestra also compose and perform their own pieces, as well as arranging medleys - for example, David Bowie's \"Life on Mars?\" is melded with \"My Way\", \"For Once in My Life\", \"Substitute\", and more.  Comedic elements are incorporated with the musicianship, including up to five members playing a single ukulele and times when the group each goes its own way on a piece of music.\nThe group has shied away from featuring the music of George Formby, Britain's most famous ukulele musician; however, in recent years, they have included a version of his song \"Leaning on a Lamppost\", performed in a Russian Cossack style.[7][8]Albums[edit]Albums include Live in London #1, Live in London #2, Still Live, Precious Little, The Secret of Life, Top Notch and a large back catalogue of recordings. They have released two DVDs, Anarchy in the Ukulele (2005), recorded at the Barbican in London, as well as Prom Night, a DVD of their BBC Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall recorded in 2009. Their version of \"Dy-na-mi-tee\" (with vocals by Hester Goodman), reached #81 in the UK singles charts in 2005. Also featured on the CD single were covers of the instrumental \"Wonderful Land\", and of \"Natural Woman\", the latter with (male) lead vocals provided by musical director George Hinchliffe.\nPerformances[edit]The orchestra has toured the US, Canada, Japan, China, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Norway, Ireland and Great Britain.\nRecent years have seen television appearances on programmes such as Jools Holland's Hootenanny and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway performing alongside Robbie Williams.[9] High praise has been forthcoming from the press for live shows.[10][11] The orchestra performed at the 50th anniversary VE day celebrations in Hyde Park (with Cliff Richard and Vera Lynn), before an estimated audience of 170,000.\nOften the orchestra will provide advanced notice of an audience participation number.  They provide a link to the piece online so that those that wish to participate can come prepared.\nOther projects[edit]In 2008, the group performed Dreamspiel, a ukulele opera, composed by George Hinchliffe and Michelle Carter for the Grimeborn Festival at London's Arcola Theatre. They have also, in 2010 and 2011, performed Ukulelescope where they played music to accompany silent movies from the British Film Institute archives. In 2012, Waly Waly on the Ukulele reworked arrangements of Cecil Sharp's collected folk tunes for performances at the Birmingham Town Hall and Cecil Sharp House in London. (Recordings from these shows were released in 2016 as the CD The Keeper.) In 2013 they issued a special collaboration with Ibiza Air for their Cover of the Song Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down). They released an EP with 4 Remixes in different styles like Tech house and Chill-out. In 2014, to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of The Great War, the orchestra presented When This Lousy War is Over which reflected a range of attitudes from the time; patriotic, pacifist and feminist, and drew from gipsy music, music hall, soldiers' songs and even a song from the then radical avante-garde Cabaret Voltaire in neutral Switzerland.[12]BBC Proms world record[edit]On Tuesday 18 August 2009 the UOGB performed in a late night prom in the BBC Proms 2009 Season at the Royal Albert Hall. The performance was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and received much critical acclaim. As well as this, the concert hosted what was then thought[by whom?] to be the world record for the largest number of ukulele players playing with each other at once, at least 992 players participated in a version of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. A DVD of the performance, Prom Night, was released the same year.\nLine-up[edit]The orchestra has had varying line-ups over the past two decades, but since 2005 has performed as an octet, with eight ukulele players including one who plays bass ukulele. The members wear traditional orchestra dress for performances, with the men in black tie and the women in smart evening wear.  Kitty Lux, co-founder with George Hinchcliff,[13] died on 16 July 2017.[14]Discography[edit]Studio albums[edit]The Ukulele Variations \u2013 1988, Disque Ethnique (LP); CBS/Sony Records (CD)Hearts of Oak \u2013 1990, CBS/Sony Records (CD)A Fist Full of Ukuleles \u2013 1994, Sony Records (CD)Pluck \u2013 1998, Tachyon Records (CD)The Secret of Life \u2013 2004, Longman Records (CD)Miss Dy-na-mi-tee \u2013 2005, Longman Records (CD single)Precious Little \u2013 2007, UOGB (CD)Christmas with the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain \u2013 2008, UOGB (CD)(Ever Such) Pretty Girls \u2013 2015, UOGB (CD)Live albums[edit]Live in London #1 \u2013 2008, UOGB (CD)Live in London #2 \u2013 2009, UOGB (CD)Still Live \u2013 2011, UOGB (CD)Uke-Werk \u2013 2013, UOGB (CD)The Keeper \u2013 2016, UOGB (CD)Compilations[edit]Top Notch \u2013 2001, UOGB (CD)Bang Bang(My Baby Shot Me Down) EP - The Ukulele Orchestra Vs Ibiza Air \u2013 2013, UOGB (CD)DVDs[edit]Anarchy in the Ukulele \u2013 2005, UOGB (DVD)Prom Night \u2013 Live at the Royal Albert Hall \u2013 BBC Proms 2009 \u2013 2009, UOGB (DVD)The Ukes Down Under \u2013 2012, Litmus Films (DVD)The Ukes In America \u2013 2013, Litmus Films (DVD)Current members[edit]David SuichPeter Brooke TurnerHester GoodmanGeorge HinchliffeRichie WilliamsWill Grove-WhiteJonty Bankes (bass ukulele)Leisa Rea (joined 2006)Ben Rouse (joined 2015)The group has a small number of individuals who regularly serve as substitutes:\nDave Bowie (original member, now bass dep)Nick Browning (deps on various instruments and also plays in the Ukes & Lutes side project with founder member George Hinchcliffe).Past members[edit]Kitty Lux (1985-2017)References[edit]^\"The Ukulele Orchestra Players\".

Marcos also worked as a social worker in child protective services, services for the developmentally disabled and union leader. Torres Small was raised in Las Cruces, New Mexico.[2][3]After graduating high school from Mayfield High School in absentia while she earned her International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma from Waterford Kamhlaba United World College in Mbabane, Eswatini, she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Georgetown University and her Juris Doctor from the University of New Mexico School of Law.[4][2][5]Torres Small worked as a field representative for U.S. Senator Tom Udall from 2009 to 2012.

The incumbent, Steve Pearce, declined to run for reelection in order to run for Governor of New Mexico.[7] Torres Small defeated Madeline Hildebrandt in the Democratic Partyprimary election, and defeated Republican nominee Yvette Herrell in the November 6, 2018, general election.[8][9] On November 7, 2018, following the final absentee ballot counts, Torres Small was declared the winner by the New Mexico Secretary of State.[10] Torres Small ran as a moderate Democrat.[11]The results were close on election night, with Herrell in the lead at the end of the night and some New Mexico media organizations projecting that Herrell would win.[11] The next day, more ballots were counted which narrowed Herrell's lead, and media organizations rescinded their projections.[11] The Associated Press called the election for Torres Small on November 7, 2018.[11] Herrell refused to concede and went on to claim, without evidence, that the ballot counting may not have been conducted lawfully. Herrell claimed on Fox News on November 10, 2018, that New Mexico Secretary of StateMaggie Toulouse Oliver had \"magically found 4,000 ballots that had not been counted.\" However, the votes in question were absentee ballots which were tabulated in full view of reporters on November 7, 2018.[12] Herrell claimed in the Fox News interview that there were \"over 100 documented complaints about some of the things that happened during this race\", but did not elaborate on the complaints or substantiate them with documents.[12]Tenure[edit]In her first week in office, she and other members of the CHC traveled to the United States Border Patrol station at Alamogordo, New Mexico, where Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonzo, an eight-year-old Guatemalan immigrant, died in custody.[13]Committee assignments[edit]Committee on Armed ServicesSubcommittee on ReadinessSubcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces (Vice Chair)Committee on Homeland SecuritySubcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation and OperationsSubcommittee on Oversight, Management and Accountability (Chair)Caucus memberships[edit]Blue Dog Coalition[14]Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues[15]Congressional Hispanic Caucus[16]New Democrat Coalition[17]Personal life[edit]In 2016, Small's husband, Nathan Small, was elected in District 36 as a Democratic member of the New Mexico House of Representatives.[7] He ran for reelection in 2018, winning with 59.9% of the general election vote.[18][19] She is a Lutheran.[20]Electoral history[edit]New Mexico 2nd congressional district, 2018.[21]Party\nCandidate\nVotes\n%\n\n\n\nDemocraticXochitl Torres Small101,48950.93%\n\n\nRepublicanYvette Herrell97,767\n49.07%\n\n\nTotal votes\n199,256100%\n\nSee also[edit]Women in the United States House of RepresentativesReferences[edit]^\"Candidate Conversation - Xochitl Torres-Small (D)\".

LampsonMember of the Ohio House of Representativesfrom the 38th districtIn officeJanuary 3, 1963-December 31, 1972Preceded byRalph L. HumphreySucceeded byRobert BoggsPersonal detailsBornMay 17, 1904Jefferson, OhioDiedOctober 5, 1997(1997-10-05) (aged\u00a093)Punta Gorda, FloridaResting placeOakdale Cemetery, JeffersonPolitical partyRepublicanSpouse(s)Doris Leona DureyChildrenoneAlma materMiami University of OhioElbert Wellington 'Ab' Lampson (May 17, 1904 \u2013 October 5, 1997) was an American politician who was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives.\nLampson, a native of Ashtabula County, was the son of E.C. \"Chet\" and Pearle Evans Lampson.  His grandfather was Ohio Lieutenant Governor, Elbert L. Lampson.\nPolitics was important to Lampson, who served 10 years in the Ohio House of Representatives.  He was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee when the first state income tax was passed in 1970.  He convinced 12 fellow Republicans to cross party lines and join minority Democrats in passing the legislation.  The decision later was reaffirmed in a referendum vote by Ohio citizens.\nAfter that term, he retired from the General Assembly.  During his first term in the General Assembly in 1963, he was voted one of six outstanding freshman legislators by a bipartisan board.\nMr. Lampson lived most of his life in Jefferson, Ohio, and moved to Florida in 1979.  He graduated from Miami University in Oxford,  Ohio in 1927.  He was a two-year letterman on the college track team, winning medals in the Drake Medley Relays in 1926.\nDuring his early years in Jefferson, he became active in numerous organizations, being the youngest man to hold the top office of the Jefferson Masonic Lodge.  He also organized and was a charter member of the Jefferson Exchange Club. He was a volunteer firefighter, Jefferson Grange member and past patron of the Sunshine Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star.  He also was a member of Ashtabula Elks Lodge 208, Sons of the American Revolution and the Ashtabula County Historical Society.   He also was active with the Ashtabula County Fair, serving as fair board secretary from 1938 to 1946.  He was director of the board for several additional years.\nA desire for bigger, better fairs in Ashtabula County led him to an active role in the Ohio Fair Managers Association, which he served as president from 1947 to 1949.[1]  He was the only Ashtabula County native to serve in that organization.\nLampson joined Gazette Newspapers, a family business, in 1927.  Among its publications are the Jefferson Gazette, the Conneaut Courier and the Pymatuning Valley Area News.  Mr. Lampson was active in newspaper organizations, and served as past president of the Buckeye Press Association, and as trustee, president and chairman of the board of the Ohio Newspaper Association.  He served the latter group from 1951 to 1976.\nIn 1953, Mr. Lampson helped found the Jefferson Development Corp., of which he was a director for 30 years.  He also served as a precinct committeeman, a member of the County GOP Executive Committee and was, from 1942 to 1954, a member of the Ashtabula County Board of Elections.\nIn 1966, the Jefferson Chamber of Commerce named Mr. Lampson \"Outstanding Citizen of the Year.\"  He was the first second-generation family member to be so honored, his father, Chet, having received the honor in 1952.\nSource: Obituary, Ashtabula Star Beacon, Oct. 8 1997\nReferences[edit]^The Billboard: Lampson named Ohio Fair Managers presidentE.

Bush\u00a0(CVN-77), the aircraft carrier named after him.The naming of United States Navy vessels after living people was common in early decades of American history, but by World War II, the Navy had firmly established a practice of naming ships for people only after they had died.[1]  In 1969, a Navy panel decreed that warships would no longer be named after living persons.[1] That lasted until 1974, when President Richard Nixon announced the naming of an aircraft carrier after United States RepresentativeCarl Vinson.[1]  Since then, ships such as the Arleigh Burke, Henry M. Jackson, Bob Hope, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Gabrielle Giffords have been named for people still alive at the time.\nThe U.S. Navy generally announces the name of a ship some time before it is launched, and well before it is accepted for purchase and commissioned into active service.\nContents1List of ships1.11770s1.21790s1.31800s1.41810s1.51820s1.61830s1.71850s1.81900s1.91980s1.101990s1.112000s1.122010s2See also3References\n\nList of ships[edit]The following ships received their names while their namesakes were alive.

As a representative of Germany's national team, Schachtsiek won four world titles (1986, 1990, 1992 and 1995). He was also a European champion in 1988 and 1994. At the World Games, in which non-Olympic sports are represented, Schachtsiek won the gold medal in 1989 in 1993.\nPlaying for TSV Hagen 1860, a team located in the federal state of Northrhine-Westfalia, Schachtsiek amassed 17 national titles (ten outdoors and seven indoors). In 1986, Schachtsiek was a German champion for the first time. The last time he placed first was 2001. Schachtsiek and Hagen were also world cup winners, accumulating twelve consecutive titles on the European club level (indoors). Schachtsiek also led Hagen to seven outdoor titles.\nSchachtsiek's father-in-law, Manfred Lux, is the mastermind of fistball, editing the \"Faustball Informationen\". Schachtsiek still plays on the senior level. He is one of the four vice-presidents of the German fistball League (Deutsche Faustball-Liga-DFBL). Unofficially, he is the manager of Germany's national team, which allows a comparison to Oliver Bierhoff in football. Amongst fistballers, Schachtsiek is highly revered.\nSchachtsiek lives with his wife Andrea and their two sons in Hagen.\nReferences[edit]^Lee, Christian. \"Interview mit Jahrhundertfaustballer Dirk Schachtsiek\".

Two of his brothers, Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway and John also became Liberal Members of Parliament.  Walter Mclaren was married in April 1883 to Eva Muller.[2] They became a powerful pair of women's rights advocates with Eva calling herself Mrs Eva McLaren and not the expected Mrs Walter McLaren. Eva stood successfully for public office as far as it was permitted at the time. She campaigned for further rights as treasurer of the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors and Walter served on its successor organisation the Women's Local Government Society. Walter introduced a clause to the 1894 Local Government Act which extended the voting rights of married women.[3]McLaren first stood for election to the House of Commons at the 1885 general election, when he stood as an \"independent liberal\" candidate for the Inverness district of Burghs, in Scotland. He had been nominated by the Free Church Constitutional Party, and polled strongly against the official Liberal Party candidate, taking 47.5% of the votes.[4]At the 1886 general election he was elected in Crewe, where the sitting Liberal MP George Latham had not sought re-election. McLaren was re-elected in 1892, but lost his seat at the  1895 general election.He did not stand in 1900, when the seat was regained for the Liberals by James Tomkinson, but when Tomkinson died shortly after being re-elected at the January 1910 election, McLaren was the successful Liberal candidate in the resulting by-election.[5] He held the seat until his own death in 1912, aged 59.[4]Walter is buried with his parents in St Cuthberts Churchyard in Edinburgh. Although the monument, lying on the east wall of the first south section under Edinburgh Castle, is huge, Walter is relegated to a simple footnote at the base of the stone.\nReferences[edit]^\"House of Commons constituencies beginning with \"C\" (part 6)\".

(2009) proposed to redefine Colubroidea for colubrids and related families, while naming Colubroides for the group containing vipers, cobras as well as colubroids.[1]Below are the families and subfamilies that are found in Colubroidea sensu stricto:[1][2][3][4]Family: Sibynophiidae Dunn, 1928Family: NatricidaeBonaparte, 1838Family: Pseudoxenodontidae McDowell, 1987Family: Dipsadidae Bonaparte, 1838\nSubfamily: Carphophiinae Zaher et al., 2009[1]Subfamily: Xenodontinae Dunn, 1928Subfamily: Dipsadinae Bonaparte, 1838Family: ColubridaeOppel, 1811\nSubfamily: Grayiinae G\u00fcnther, 1858Subfamily: Calamariinae Bonaparte, 1838Subfamily: Ahaetullinae  Figueroa, McKelvy, Grismer, Bell & Lailvaux, 2016Subfamily: ColubrinaeOppel, 1811Below is the phylogeny of the group:[1][2][3][4].mw-parser-output table.clade{border-spacing:0;margin:0;font-size:100%;line-height:100%;border-collapse:separate;width:auto}.mw-parser-output table.clade table.clade{width:100%}.mw-parser-output table.clade td{border:0;padding:0;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output table.clade td.clade-label{width:0.8em;border:0;padding:0 0.2em;vertical-align:bottom;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output table.clade td.clade-slabel{border:0;padding:0 0.2em;vertical-align:top;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output table.clade td.clade-bar{vertical-align:middle;text-align:left;padding:0 0.5em}.mw-parser-output table.clade td.clade-leaf{border:0;padding:0;text-align:left;vertical-align:middle}.mw-parser-output table.clade td.clade-leafR{border:0;padding:0;text-align:right}\n\n\nColubroidea\n\n\nColubridae\n\n\n\u202f\n\n\n\n\u202f\nGrayiinae\u202f\n\u202f\nCalamariinae\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\n\n\n\u202f\nAhaetuliinae\u202f\n\u202f\nColubrinae\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\n\n\n\u202f\n\n\n\n\u202f\nSibynophiidae\u202f\n\u202f\nNatricidae\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\n\n\n\u202f\nPseudoxenodontidae\u202f\n\u202f\n\n\n\nDipsadidae\n\n\n\u202f\nCarphophiinae\u202f\n\u202f\n\n\n\n\u202f\nXenodontinae\u202f\n\u202f\nDipsadinae\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\n\u202f\nReferences[edit]^ abcdeZaher, H.; Grazziotin, F.

He founded the Charles E. Hires Co., which manufactured and distributed Hires Root Beer.[1]Contents1Biography1.1Early life2Career2.1Personal life3See also4References5External links\n\nBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Hires was born on August 19, 1851 to a Quaker family in Salem County, New Jersey.[2][3] At age 12, his parents sent him to work as an apprentice at a drugstore owned by his brothers-in-law.[3] When he was 16 he moved to Philadelphia and worked in a pharmacy. He saved until he had nearly $400, when he started his own drugstore.\nCareer[edit]Hires reportedly learned about root beer on his honeymoon in New Jersey, where the woman who ran the hotel served a tisane known as \"root tea\" made from roots.[3] His friend Russell Conwell, who went on to found Temple University, suggested that \"root beer\" would be more appealing to the working class. Originally, Hires packaged the mixture in boxes and sold it to housewives and proprietors of soda fountains. They needed to mix in water, sugar, and yeast.\nThe drink was slow to catch on, but Conwell persuaded Hires to present his product at the 1876 U.S. Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. To make it stand out, he called his drink \"the temperance drink\" and \"the greatest health-giving beverage in the world.\" Soon after, business flourished and Hires opened a factory at 117-119 Arch Street in Philadelphia.[4]Hires did not drink and marketed root beer as an alternative to alcohol.[5] However, following an analysis that suggested there was alcohol in root beer, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union launched a boycott of his product. Hires ran his own analysis and advertised heavily that the amount of alcohol was about the same as in a half loaf of bread.[5]Personal life[edit]He married Clara Kate Smith in 1875.

Its members are not all mothers or even all women, as there are many parents, men, widows, singles and grandparents involved in its work. Its main aim is to support monogamous marriage and family life, especially through times of adversity.\nContents1History2Mothers' Union today3Aim and objectives4Structure5Prayer6See also7References8External links\n\nHistory[edit]The organisation was founded by Mary Sumner in 1876 in the Church of Englandparish of Old Alresford, near Winchester, where her husband was rector. She was inspired to start the movement after the birth of her first grandchild. Remembering her own difficulties when she was first a mother, Sumner wanted to bring mothers of all social classes together to provide support for one another and to be trained in motherhood, something which she saw as a vocation.\n  Banner made in 1906 for the Mothers' Union of St Mary's parish church, Broomfield, EssexIn 1885 Ernest Roland Wilberforce, the first Bishop of Newcastle, was preparing to address churchgoing women in the Portsmouth Church Congress. Finding he had nothing relevant to say to churchwomen, he contacted Mary Sumner and asked her to speak to the conference in his stead. Although she was reluctant and beset by nervousness, she addressed the women passionately about the power of mothers to change the nation for the better. A number of the women present were encouraged to return to their parishes to set up similar women's meetings, and the Bishop of Winchester, who presided over the congress, declared that the Mothers' Union become a diocesan organisation. The growth of the movement beyond the boundary of the Diocese of Winchester was due to the emphasis in Victorian British society on morality and contending with social ills as well as the growth in Anglican mission throughout the British Empire.\nMothers' Union spread rapidly to the dioceses of Ely, Exeter, Hereford, Lichfield and Newcastle, and then throughout the United Kingdom. By 1892, there were 60,000 members in 28 dioceses, which grew to 169,000 members by the turn of the century. In 1893, annual general meetings were organised, and, in 1896, Mothers' Union Central Council was formed. Mary Sumner was unanimously elected president, a post she held into her nineties. In 1897, during her Diamond Jubilee, Queen Victoria became patron of Mothers' Union, giving it an unprecedented stamp of approval. Mary Sumner's Mothers' Union set up branches throughout the British Empire, beginning in New Zealand, then Canada and India. She lived to lead the Mothers' Union to act in rebuilding the heart of Britain after the First World War, and saw the first Mothers' Union Conference of Overseas Workers in 1920.\nMothers' Union today[edit]  Mary Sumner House, Mother's Union headquarters, Tufton Street, LondonAs a global movement of women and men, Mothers' Union supports local churches with the prayers and activities of its branch members, local communities through social outreach projects and is an international campaigning charity. Particularly concerned with the plight of women in the World, its projects include literacy and development, parenting, micro finance and campaigning against violence against women and the trafficking of women. Mothers' Union is part of Make Poverty History and the Jubilee Debt Coalition. In the UK it has successfully lobbied government to introduce the right to request flexible working for all parents, and internationally it speaks out on issues of gender equality through its representative status at the United Nations. Campaigning in the UK has also included lobbying for industry and policy change with regard to the commercialization and sexualisation of children. This led to then chief executive, Reg Bailey, being appointed in 2010 to lead an independent review for the UK Government, the Bailey Review.\nOf its four million members, about 1.9 million are from Indian dioceses from the formerly independent churchwomen's organisations of the Church of North India and the Church of South India, which affiliated with the Mothers' Union in 2001 and 2003 respectively. A further 1.3 million Mothers' Union members are in African dioceses, with the largest membership, 680,000, in Tanzania. Membership in the United Kingdom is about 93,000[when?] and has seen rapid declines from 122,000 in 2003 and more than 222,000 in 1993.[1]Aim and objectives[edit]From the Mothers' Union website:  Mothers' Union banner of the Diocese of BermudaIts vision is of a World where God's love is shown through loving, respectful, and flourishing relationships.\nAim & Purpose: To demonstrate the Christian faith in action by the transformation of communities worldwide through the nurture of the family in its many forms.\nIn order to carry out this aim, Mothers' Union's objectives are:\nTo uphold Christ's teaching on the nature of marriage and promote its wider understanding.To encourage parents to bring up their children in the faith and life of the Church.To maintain a worldwide fellowship of Christians united in prayer, worship and service.To promote conditions in society favourable to stable family life and the protection of children.To help those whose family life has met with adversity.Structure[edit]Mothers' Union developed within the Anglican Communion and uses its structure as its own. Individual branches are usually based on parishes or small groups of parishes. There are often levels of co-ordination corresponding to deaneries and archdeaconries, that link the branch organisations with that of the diocese. The Anglican provinces each have their own administration, which, in turn, supports the worldwide President, currently Lynne Tembey. The worldwide headquarters is in Mary Sumner House in Westminster, London.\nPrayer[edit]Mothers' Union emphasises the importance of prayer underpinning its work. Each year, Mothers' Union organises a Wave of Prayer. Each diocese is given a set day to pray for other dioceses, and within each diocese each branch is given a specific time to pray. This gives to members a sense of unity in prayer for one another as the wave of prayer moves from branch to branch and from diocese to diocese.\nSee also[edit]Women's InstituteReferences[edit]^Jonathan Petre (18 November 2003). \"Mothers' Union tells newly-weds to take Aids test\".

She serves as correspondent for the network's NFL and college basketball programming.\nContents1Early life2Career2.1Boston Globe2.2Begins television career at CBS Sports2.3ABC Sports and ESPN2.4Return to CBS Sports3Personal life4Achievements4.1Events4.2Honors5References6External links\n\nEarly life[edit]Born on September 11, 1953, in Quincy, Massachusetts,[5] to a school teacher and engineer, Visser loved sports from an early age. On Halloween, when other little girls would dress up as Mary Poppins, she would go as former Boston Celtics guard Sam Jones. From the age of 10 she wanted to be a sportswriter, but there was one problem\u2014the job didn\u2019t exist for women. Her family didn't discourage her. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t say girls can\u2019t do that, and my mother told me, \u2018Sometimes you have to cross when it says \u201cdon\u2019t walk.\u201d\u2019\u201d After graduating from South Hadley High School, Visser was educated at Boston College, majoring in English.[6]Career[edit]Boston Globe[edit]In 1974, Visser won a prestigious Carnegie Foundation grant which entitled her to work as a sportswriter at The Boston Globe. In 14 years at the Globe, she covered college basketball, the NBA, Major League Baseball, tennis, college football, golf and horse racing. In 1976, she was assigned to cover the New England Patriots, becoming the first ever female NFL beat writer. In 2009, Sports Illustrated named The Boston Globe sports sections (1975\u20131980) the best sports section of all time.\nIn January 1981, Visser made national news with her story regarding the 1978-79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal after gamblers and members of the New York Mafia erroneously told her Boston College Eagle basketball player Michael Bowie was involved. The Globe subsequently reached a settlement with Bowie which included a confidentially clause. ESPN producer Joe Levine convinced Bowie to break and speak to the network.[7] Michael Bowie was never drafted by the NBA and these events had no impact on him as a pro prospect.\nBegins television career at CBS Sports[edit]In 1983, she did a few features for CBS. In 1984, Visser joined CBS Sports part-time and went full-time in 1987. Her assignments included the NBA including the NBA Finals, college basketball including the Final Four, MLB including the World Series, College World Series,[8]college football, horse racing, Tennis including the U.S. Open of Tennis (1984\u20131993) and the Olympics.\nIn 1989 she covered the fall of the Berlin Wall, focusing on how sports would change in East Germany. In 1990 she became a regular on The NFL Today with Greg Gumbel, Terry Bradshaw and Pat O'Brien. Also in 1990, Visser became the first woman to cover the World Series. In 1992, she became the first and only woman to handle the Super Bowl Trophy presentation.\nABC Sports and ESPN[edit]After CBS lost television rights to NFL games in 1993, Visser went to ABC Sports and ESPN. In 1995, she became the first woman ever to report from the sidelines during a Super Bowl when she covered Super Bowl XXIX for ABC. In 1998, she became the first woman ever assigned to Monday Night Football. She also covered Super Bowl XXXIV for ABC in 2000.\nWhile at ABC Sports, Visser served as a reporter for college football bowl games and the NFL playoffs games during Wild Card Saturday. She also contributed to horse racing including the Triple Crown, ABC's Wide World of Sports, Major League Baseball, including the 1995 World Series, figure skating, Special Olympics, skiing, the Pro Bowl, and an ABC series A Passion to Play. She co-hosted the network's coverage of the \"MillenniumTournament of Roses Parade.\"\nFor ESPN, Visser covered the Super Bowl, college basketball, figure skating, and horse racing including the Triple Crown.[9] She also contributed to SportsCenter, NFL GameDay, and Monday Night Countdown.\nReturn to CBS Sports[edit]In August 2000, Visser returned to CBS, with her assignments being NFL, college basketball, Tennis, Figure Skating and Horse Racing as well as special projects for CBS News. Today Visser's assignments are a contributor to The NFL Today and college basketball. In 2004, she became the first woman sportscaster to carry the Olympic Torch when she was honored in 2004 by the International Olympic Committee as a \"pioneer and standard-bearer.\"\nDuring the 2001 NFL season Visser became the first female color analyst[10] (NBC's Gayle Sierens was the first female play-by-play announcer) on an NFL broadcast booth. She joined play-by-play announcer Howard David and analyst Boomer Esiason in the booth for Westwood One/CBS Radio. Visser also joined HBO's highly acclaimed Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.\nVisser was a pre-game reporter for The Super Bowl Today, where she covered the Super Bowl XXXV in February 2001, Super Bowl XXXVIII in February 2004, and the Super Bowl XLI in February 2007 pre-game broadcasts and during that 2007 Super Bowl she did serve as a sideline reporter too. Visser did contribute to the pre-game broadcast of the 2010 Super Bowl as well as the 2013 Super Bowl. Visser was loaned to NBC Sports twice to cover the Olympics as she covered the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens when she served as the Equestrian reporter. She also covered the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino as a reporter for Short Track Speed Skating.\nIn September 2007, she returned to roots as she now writes a column for CBSSports.com.\nPersonal life[edit]Visser was married from 1983 to 2010 to sportscaster Dick Stockton, who broadcasts football and baseball for Fox and baseball and the NBA for Turner Sports. Visser and Stockton met at the sixth game of the 1975 World Series, where Stockton called Carlton Fisk's iconic home run for NBC and Visser was covering the game for The Boston Globe.\nVisser has been married since July 2011 to businessman and former Harvard basketball captain Bob Kanuth.[11]In June 1993, Visser suffered a jogging accident in New York's Central Park, breaking her hip and skidding head-first across the pavement.[12] She needed surgery on her face and hip then in 2006 she required an artificial hip replacement.\nAchievements[edit]Events[edit]Visser has covered a number of events:\n34 Final Fours12 NBA Finals7 World Series15 Kentucky Derbys7 Preakness Stakes10 Belmont Stakes3 Summer Olympics3 Winter Olympics28 Super Bowls7 World Figure Skating Championships29 US Open (tennis)15 WimbledonsHonors[edit]In June 2006, Visser was named the first female recipient of the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. That same month, she was honored by the American Women in Radio and Television as the first woman sportscaster recipient of a Gracie Allen Award that celebrates programming created for women, by women and about women, as well as individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the industry. In 2007, she became the first woman sportscaster to host the Gracie Awards. Also in 2007, Visser received the Emily Couric Leadership Award\u2014previously given to Sandra Day O'Connor, Caroline Kennedy and Donna Brazile\u2014and in 2007, she was honored at the 22nd Annual Sports Legend Dinner, along with Magic Johnson, Gary Player and John Elway to benefit the Buoniconti fund to cure paralysis. In 2005 she won the Pop Warner female achievement award and was inducted into the New England Sports Museum Hall of Fame, along with Boston Celtics legend Bob Cousy and the 1980 United States Olympic Hockey team.\nVisser was honored with the Compass Award for 'changing the paradigm of her business' and was one of 100 luminaries commemorating the 75th anniversary of the CBS Television Network in 2003. She was also named \"WISE Woman of the Year\" in 2002 and voted the \"Outstanding Women's Sportswriter in America\" in 1983 and won the \"Women's Sports Foundation Award for Journalism\" in 1992. In 1999 she won the first AWSM Pioneer Award. Visser earned her bachelor's degree in English from Boston College and received an honorary doctorate of Journalism from her alma mater in May 2007.\nVisser became the first woman sportscaster to carry the Olympic Torch when she was honored in 2004 by the International Olympic Committee as a \"pioneer and standard-bearer.\" Visser worked her 31st Final Four/NCAA Men's Basketball Championship this April 2009, having worked the tournament for the Boston Globe, ESPN and CBS Sports. This past season marked her 34th year covering the NFL.\nIn 2005, Visser was elected to the Museum of Television and Radio. Sean McManus, President of CBS News and CBS Sports, summed up her contributions this way: \"Lesley Visser's career has broken many barriers and defined previously unimagined roles for women in professional sports and sports broadcasting.\"\nOn June 8, 2015, Visser was inducted in the NSSA Hall of Fame, along with Bill Raftery, Hal McCoy and the late Dick Schaap. She is the third woman to be accorded this honor since the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association began presenting it in 1962.\nReferences[edit]^Hiestand, Michael (2009-09-04). \"Economy affects some NFL teams' worth\".

From 1992 to 2015, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) representing the constituency of Havant in Hampshire. He served as Minister of State for Universities and Science from 2010 until July 2014 and became a member of the House of Lords in 2015.\nContents1Education2Policy researcher3First period in government4Shadow Cabinet5Second period in government5.1Feminism claim5.2Tuition fees and student loan debts5.3Standing down5.4Brexit6Free votes record7Other Interests8Civic conservatism9Personal life and member's interests10Honours10.1Scholastic10.2Memberships and Fellowships11Published works12References13External links\n\nEducation[edit]  Willetts was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics.[1][2] Willetts graduated with a first class degree.\nPolicy researcher[edit]Having served as Nigel Lawson's private researcher,[3] Willetts took charge of the Treasurymonetary policy division at 26 before moving over to Margaret Thatcher's Policy Unit at 28. Aged 31, he subsequently took over the Centre for Policy Studies.[4]Paul Foot wrote in the Private Eye that in a 1993 document called The Opportunities for Private Funding in the NHS, published by the Social Market Foundation and financed by private healthcare company BUPA, Willetts provided the \"intellectual thrust\" for private finance initiatives (PFIs) in the National Health Service.[5]First period in government[edit]  Willetts' constituency officeAged 36, Willetts entered Parliament in 1992 as the MP for Havant. He quickly established himself in Parliament, becoming a Whip, a Cabinet Office Minister, and then Paymaster General in his first term (when that role was split between the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury as a policy co-ordination role). During this period Willetts gained \"Two Brains\" as a nickname, a monicker reportedly coined by The Guardian's former political editor Michael White.[6] However, Willetts was forced to resign from the latter post by the Standards and Privileges Committee over an investigation into Neil Hamilton in 1996, when it found that he had \"dissembled\" in his evidence to the Committee over whether pressure was put onto an earlier investigation into Hamilton.\nShadow Cabinet[edit]Despite the resignation, Willetts was able to return to the shadow front bench a few years later while William Hague was Leader of the Opposition, initially serving in the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Education Secretary before becoming Shadow Social Security (later Shadow Work and Pensions) Secretary.  He carved out a reputation as an expert on pensions and benefits. Since leaving the DWP post, he has been recruited as an external consultant by the actuaries Punter Southall.\nAfter the 2005 election, he served as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the Shadow Cabinet under Michael Howard. In August 2005, after ruling out running for leader owing to a lack of support, commentators speculated that he was gunning for the post Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer position and would cut a deal with either David Davis or David Cameron. On 15 September he confirmed his support for Davis, at that time the bookies' favourite. Willetts, a centrist moderniser, went to ground following the announcement of the Davis tax plan since it was widely speculated that he disagreed with the seemingly uncosted and widely derided[7] tax plan and found it impossible to defend. Davis then lost the candidacy race to Cameron.\nFollowing Cameron's win, Willetts was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Education and Skills in Cameron's first Shadow Cabinet in December 2005, the role Cameron had vacated, and later becoming Shadow Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills. His title became Shadow Minister for Universities and Skills since Gordon Brown's merger of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform into the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in June 2009.\nOn 19 May 2007, Willetts made a controversial speech on grammar schools in which he defended the existing Conservative Party policy of not reintroducing grammar schools. The speech received a mixed reception. The analysis was applauded by The Guardian and The Times.[6][8][9][10] However, the more right-wing Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail were both strongly critical of the speech, which was unpopular with some Conservative Party activists.[11][12] The speech was made more controversial when David Cameron weighed into the argument, backing Willetts' speech and describing his critics as \"delusional\", accusing them of \"splashing around in the shallow end of the educational debate\" and of \"clinging on to outdated mantras that bear no relation to the reality of life\".[13]The Department for Education and Skills was abolished by the new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who established two new departments. On 2 July 2007, Cameron reshuffled Willetts down to the junior of the two departments: the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills.\nSecond period in government[edit]Following the 2010 general election, Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Willetts as the Minister of State for Universities and Science.\nFeminism claim[edit]In June 2011, Willetts said during the launch of the Government\u2019s social mobility strategy that movement between the classes had \"stagnated\" over the past 40 years, and Willetts attributed this partly to the entry of women into the workplace and universities for the lack of progress for men. \"Feminism trumped egalitarianism\", he said, adding that women who would otherwise have been housewives had taken university places and well-paid jobs that could have gone to ambitious working-class men. He went on to say that \"One of the things that happened over that period was that the entirely admirable transformation of opportunities for women meant that with a lot of the expansion of education in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, the first beneficiaries were the daughters of middle-class families who had previously been excluded from educational opportunities\", he said. He said that \"And if you put that with what is called 'assortative mating' \u2014 that well-educated women marry well-educated men \u2013 this transformation of opportunities for women ended up magnifying social divides. It is delicate territory because it is not a bad thing that women had these opportunities, but it widened the gap in household incomes because you suddenly had two-earner couples, both of whom were well-educated, compared with often workless households where nobody was educated\".[14]Tuition fees and student loan debts[edit]As the minister responsible for universities, Willetts was an advocate and spokesperson for the coalition government's policy of increasing the cap on tuition fees in England and Wales from \u00a33,225 to \u00a39,000 per year.[15][16]In November 2013, Willetts announced the sale of student loans to Erudio Student Loans - a debt collection consortium - removing \u00a3160m from public debt but ignoring, according to The Independent, the implications for former students.[17]Standing down[edit]In July 2014, Willets announced that he would not contest the next general election, saying that \"after more than 20 years the time has come to move onto fresh challenges.\"[18] In October 2014, Willets was appointed a visiting professor at King's College London.[19] It was announced that he was to be a life peer in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and was created Baron Willetts, of Havant in the County of Hampshire, on 16 October 2015.[20] In June 2015, Willetts was appointed executive chair of the think tank the Resolution Foundation.[21] In May 2018 he was elected a Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society. [22]Brexit[edit]Willetts is one of the signatories of a statement by senior Conservatives calling for a second referendum over Brexit.  This states, \"If we are to remain a party of government, it is absolutely critical that we increase our support among younger generations.  To do this, we must listen to and engage with their concerns on Brexit. They voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the European Union in 2016 \u2013 and since then have become even stronger in their views. Since the referendum, nearly 2 million young people are now of voting age. Of those in this group who are certain to vote, an astounding 87% support the United Kingdom staying in the European Union. If we do not hear their voices, who could blame them for feeling excluded and powerless on this most vital issue. The truth is that if Brexit fails this generation, we risk losing young people for good. Our party\u2019s electoral future will be irrevocably blighted.\"[23] In early 2019, he co-founded the group Right to Vote.[24]Free votes record[edit]According to the Public Whip analyses,[25] Willetts was strongly in favour of an elected House of Lords and was strongly against the ban on fox-hunting. TheyWorkForYou additionally records that, amongst other things, Willetts was strongly in favour of the Iraq War, strongly in favour of an investigation into it, moderately against equal gay rights, and very strongly for replacing Trident.[26]Other Interests[edit]He is currently a visiting professor at King's College London where he works with the Policy Institute at King\u2019s, a visiting professor at the Cass Business School, a board member of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and a visiting fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford. On 9 February 2018, the University of Leicester announced they had elected David Willetts as successor to Bruce Grocott to become their new chancellor.[27]Willetts is the author of several books on conservatism, including \"Why Vote Conservative\" (1996) and \"Modern Conservatism\" (1992), as well as numerous articles. He was a founding signatory in 2005 of the Henry Jackson Society principles, advocating a proactive approach to the spread of liberal democracy across the world, including when necessary by military intervention.[28][29] He is an honorary member of Conservative Friends of Poland.[30]Civic conservatism[edit]Willetts has pioneered the idea of \"civic conservatism\" [D. Willetts, \"Civic Conservatism\", SMF (1994)]. This is the idea of focusing on the institutions between the state and individuals as a policy concern (rather than merely thinking of individuals and the state as the only agencies) and is one of the principles behind the increasing support in the Conservative Party's localist agenda and its emphasis on voluntary organisations.  During an interview with The Spectator, he was referred to as 'the real father of Cameronism'.[31]Fourteen years after the publication of \"Civic Conservatism\" Willetts gave the inaugural Oakeshott Memorial Lecture to the London School of Economics in which he made an attempt to explain how game theory can be used to help think about how to improve social capital.  The lecture[32] was described by the Times as \"an audacious attempt by the Conservative Party's leading intellectual to relate a new Tory narrative\".[33]Civic conservatism, like free market economics, proceeds from deep-seated individual self-interest towards a stable cooperation. It sets the Tories the task not of changing humanity but of designing institutions and arrangements that encourage our natural reciprocal altruism.[34]Personal life and member's interests[edit]Willetts is married to the artist Sarah Butterfield.[35] The couple have one daughter, born 1988, and one son, born 1992. His wealth is estimated at \u00a31.9m,[36][37] and his declarations for the Register of Members' Financial Interests may viewed here.Honours[edit]He was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2010, giving him the honorific title \"The Right Honourable\" and after ennoblement the post nominal letters \"PC\" for life.He was awarded a life peerage in 2015, allowing him to sit in the House of Lords. He took the title Baron Willetts, of Havant in the County of Hampshire. He sits with the Conservative Party benches.Scholastic[edit]University Degrees\n\nLocationDateSchoolDegree\u00a0EnglandChrist Church, OxfordFirst-class honoursBachelor of Arts (BA) in PPEChancellor, visitor, governor, and fellowships\n\nLocationDateSchoolPosition\u00a0England21 October 2014\u00a0\u2013 King's College LondonVisiting Professor  [38]\u00a0EnglandJuly 2018\u00a0\u2013 University of LeicesterChancellor  [39]\u00a0England\u00a0\u2013 Nuffield College, OxfordHonorary Fellow  [40]This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.Honorary Degrees\n\nLocationDateSchoolDegree\u00a0England21 November 2014University of BedfordshireDoctor of Arts (D.Arts)  [41]  [42]\u00a0England17 July 2016University of LeicesterDoctor of Laws (LL.D)  [43]  [44]\u00a0England4 July 2017University of BathDoctor of Laws (LL.D)  [45]  [46]\u00a0England2017Richmond, The American International University in LondonDoctor of Public Administration (DPA) [47]\u00a0England2017University of ChesterDoctor of Letters (D.Litt)  [48]This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.Memberships and Fellowships[edit]\n\nCountryDateOrganisationPosition\u00a0United Kingdom2014\u00a0\u2013 Academy of Social SciencesFellow (FAcSS)\n\u00a0United Kingdom2016\u00a0\u2013 Academy of Medical SciencesHonorary Fellow (FMedSci)  [49]  [50]\u00a0United Kingdom2017\u00a0\u2013 Royal Society of ChemistryHonorary Fellow (HonFRSC)  [51]\u00a0United Kingdom2018\u00a0\u2013 Royal SocietyHonorary Fellow (FRS)\nThis list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.Published works[edit]Happy Families?

A Democrat, he was elected to the Michigan State House of Representatives in 2006 and 2008, representing the 60th District in Kalamazoo County, which includes the City of Kalamazoo, Cooper Township and part of Kalamazoo Township.  He was the Democratic nominee for the Michigan Senate's 20th district in the November 2, 2010 election,[1] until his death just 16 days before.\nContents1Early life2Political career3Personal4Electoral history5References6External links\n\nEarly life[edit]Jones was born in Jeffersonville, Georgia on April 22, 1944.  He attended public schools in Brooklyn and graduated from John Jay High School in 1962.  In 1966 he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Fort Valley State University in Georgia.  A Master's Degree in chemistry was earned in 1971 at Clark Atlanta University.  At the time of his death, he was working on a Master of Business Administration degree at Western Michigan University.\nFor 28 years, he worked as a research chemist and a \"fine chemicals\" supervisor at The Upjohn Company in Kalamazoo, Michigan.[2]Political career[edit]Jones was elected mayor of Kalamazoo in 1997.  As mayor, he presided over significant economic growth, focusing large amounts of money on attracting new developments in the downtown area.[citation needed] He was re-elected mayor three consecutive times, serving a total of 4 terms until 2005. In 2006, he was elected to the Michigan State House to replace term-limited Representative Alexander Lipsey. He chaired the Commerce, and sat on Health Policy, Senior Health, Security and Retirement, and Tax Policy Committees.\nRepresentative Robert Jones announced he would forgo a third term in the Michigan House of Representatives and would instead run for the vacated Michigan State Senate seat from current term limited Republican Tom George. A formal announcement was made on Monday, July 20.[3]Robert Jones also had a political action committee called Jones Advocating for Michigan which has raised $124,950 as of August 2008.[4][5][6]Timothy Light is one of the top contributors to Jones' PAC.[5][7]He ran for the State Senate in the 20th District in 2010, to succeed term-limited Republican incumbent Tom George. Jones won the Democratic primary against law professor Mark Totten with 63% of the vote. He died 16 days before the election and was replaced on the ballot by Bobby Hopewell, the Mayor[8] of Kalamazoo, who had Jones' widow's blessing.[9] Republican Tonya Schuitmaker won the open seat.\nPersonal[edit]Robert Jones married Callie Baskerville.  Together, they had six children and one grandchild.  Jones lived in Kalamazoo and was an active member of Mt. Zion Baptist Church.  He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity; a lifetime member of the NAACP; a member of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge Local 10; a member of United Core of Mayors; a member of the National Brownfield Association; a member of the National League of Cities; a member of the United States Conference of Mayors; and immediate past chair of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus.  In 2003, Jones received the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Humanitarian Award.\nTwenty months following a diagnosis of esophageal cancer, Jones collapsed and died at his home on W. Michigan Ave. the morning of Sunday, October 17, 2010, after attending an early-morning service at Mt. Zion Baptist Church.[10]  A large, public \"home going celebration,\" with casket present, was held at noon on Thursday, October 28, 2010 in Western Michigan University's Miller Auditorium.  Several local newspaper, radio, and TV outlets were present to cover the event live on-line.[11]  The casket was then flown to Jeffersonville, Georgia, his birthplace, for burial.\nBob is survived by his wife, Callie Baskerville-Jones and their six children, Michelle (Moses) Sauceda in Georgia; Kenneth \"Chris\" Jones in Georgia; Jahim Baskerville in Massachusetts; Robert B. Jones, Jr. in Georgia; Jahdal Johnson in Kalamazoo; and Hari Johnson in Kalamazoo.  He is also survived by grandson Joshua Sauceda and sister Lesteen Hill.  A sister-in-law Marie Baskerville is in Connecticut while cousins Jerry and Gail Rumph and their children Victor, Quiana and Justin also survive.\nElectoral history[edit]2006 election for State HouseRobert Jones (D), 71%Armando Romero (R), 29%2008 election for State HouseRobert B Jones (D), 74%Charles Ybema (R), 26%References[edit]^\"State Rep.

On the lawn various items are found, such as a drum,  bugles, long guns, and ship anchors. Above the palm tree, there is a Phrygian cap placed as a symbol of freedom. On the lawn between the drum and the ribbon there were supposed to be two pieces of chain with a broken link symbolizing the broken chain of slavery.[citation needed]The ribbon bears the motto: French: L'Union fait la force (\"Unity Makes Strength\"), which is also the motto of several other countries. This should not be confused with the national motto of Haiti, which according to the Constitution of Haiti is \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\"\nThe oldest use of a symbol for Haiti is known since 1807. The symbol shows several national flags, with two cannons and palm trees. The symbol indicates the battle for independence of the republic. The motto, in French, means 'Strength through unity'. The use of the symbol was interrupted twice; once was during the period of Henri I. The then president Henri Christophe declared himself as the Emperor of Haiti and adopted a Royal Coat of Arms. On the yellow shield of the arm there was a phoenix rising from its flames with five-pointed stars around it, and the motto Je renais de mes cendres (I will rise in my ashes) inscribed on a ribbon outlining the shield. Two royally crowned lions supported both sides of the shield, and the motto Dieu ma cause et mon \u00e9p\u00e9e (God, my cause and my sword) was placed on another ribbon at the bottom. In 1814 Henri I slightly changed his Royal Arm, the lions were removed and the motto was changed to a Latin one: Ex cineribus nascitur (Reborn from the ashes).[1] Another change occurred in 1849, when President General Faustin Soulouque crowned himself as Emperor Faustin I. He adopted new Imperial arms, showing two cannons and a French imperial eagle. Two lions were again used as supporters and the whole was placed in a purple mantle, with a motto similar to the one Henri I used: Dieu, ma patrie et mon \u00e9p\u00e9e (God, my country and my sword). The emperor was forced to leave the country in 1859, and the old symbol was later restored. Ever since the composition has been the same, but the colors and items have changed somewhat.[2]The coat of arms is on the national flag of Haiti, but not on its civil flag.\nHistorical Coat of Arms[edit]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRoyal Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of France during Saint-Domingue\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCoat of Arms of Haiti (Jean-Jacques Dessalines era, 1804-1806)\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCoat of Arms of Haiti (Henri Christophe era, 1811-1820)\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCoat of Arms of Haiti (Duvalier era, 1964-1986)\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\tSee also[edit]Flag of HaitiNotes[edit]^Haiti^National Arms of HaitivteArmorial of North AmericaSovereign statesAntigua and BarbudaBahamasBarbadosBelizeCanadaCosta RicaCubaDominicaDominican RepublicEl SalvadorGrenadaGuatemalaHaitiHondurasJamaicaMexicoNicaraguaPanamaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesTrinidad and TobagoUnited StatesDependencies andother territoriesAnguillaArubaBermudaBonaireBritish Virgin IslandsCayman IslandsCura\u00e7aoGreenlandGuadeloupeMartiniqueMontserratNavassa IslandPuerto RicoSaint Barth\u00e9lemySaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSabaSint EustatiusSint MaartenTurks and Caicos IslandsUnited States Virgin Islands\n\n", "tags": ["en.wikipedia.org", "wiki", "coat", "arms", "haiti"]}

As for the name Teddybears, Joakim \u00c5hlund says, \"If you're familiar with the Swedish or Norwegian black metal scene, you know back then every band was called things like 'Corpse Grinder From Hell'. So we called ourselves the Teddybears as an 'anti' thing. We were the hardest rocking [band] in Sweden and we're calling ourselves the Teddybears.\"[1] The band members started to wear large bear masks in album art and promotional photographs sometime after 2006, before that they appeared in concert and on photos without disguises.[1] The band initially consisted of Patrik Arve and brothers Joakim and Klas \u00c5hlund, before drummer Olsson joined them. They released their debut album You Are Teddybears in 1993 and their second album, titled I Can't Believe It's Teddybears STHLM followed in 1996. Their third album Rock 'n' Roll Highschool came out in 2000 and consisted of electronic elements, which were a departure from the band's previous hardcore sound. A fourth album, Fresh, was released in 2005 and included the singles \"Cobrastyle\" and \"Hey Boy\".\nJoakim \u00c5hlund is also the lead guitarist and songwriter for the band Caesars, who are best known for their hit single \"Jerk It Out\". Klas \u00c5hlund has produced most of the Caesars' albums and also produced Robyn's 2005 self-titled album. The two brothers also direct television adverts and music videos.\nTheir song \"Cobrastyle\" is featured on the soundtrack of the FIFA 06 and Forza Motorsport 2 video games. It was also used in the ending credits of the film Employee of the Month and WWE's Summerslam 2006 as the official theme song for the event. It was featured prominently in the pilot episode of NBC's 2007 comedy show Chuck as well. A part from their song \"Move Over\", from the album Rock 'n' Roll Highschool, was used in the 2004 video game Driv3r as the main menu music. In a recent commercial, Intel had used a sample of the band's song \"Different Sound\", to promote their new Intel Core 2 Duo processor. In 2009, Telus used the track \"Ahead of My Time\" in their 'Downtime' TV advertisement.[2] Their song \"Devil's Music\" was featured in the 2010 video game Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. Their song \"Next to You\" an early version of the song, \"Get Fresh With You\" without vocalist Laza Morgan was featured on the soundtrack for NBA Live 09.\nTheir song \"Different Sound\" was featured on the soundtrack album for the Hugh Grant film Music and Lyrics, as well as on Numb3rs' Season 3 Episode 4, \"The Mole\". They also made a remix of \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees which was featured on the 2007 album, Bee Gees Greatest (Special Edition).[3]The group has a global music publishing deal with BMG Music Publishing. They have signed to Atlantic Records and Big Beat/Atlantic Records released their first North American album, Soft Machine on 12 September 2006, under the shortened moniker Teddybears.[4] The album includes appearances from Iggy Pop, Annie, Ebbot Lundberg of The Soundtrack of Our Lives, Mad Cobra, Elephant Man, and Neneh Cherry.[1]In an interview with Scandinavian news agency TT Spectra, Joakim \u00c5hlund states that he is working on a new Teddybears album. Two tracks are already recorded with rapper Slick Rick and Flaming Lips  frontman Wayne Coyne.[5]In an August 2009 interview with Swedish newspaper Expressen Joakim \u00c5hlund states that the new album will be released during the fall and that it will feature a song with Swingfly and Coco Sumner, the daughter of Sting. He explains that the album will be a party album but one track will be more political and criticize the American religious right.[6]In the summer of 2009, they released the track \"Get Mama a House\" as part of the advertising campaign for a Swedish real estate company.[7] The album Devil's Music was released on 24 March 2010.\nOn 16 May 2014, the band exclusively regrouped for Vans's sponsor party in the upcoming neighborhood of Kungsholmen in Stockholm. The band played \"Ahead of My Time\" and \"Punkrocker\" while distributing Vans shoes and socks to the audience.[citation needed]Members[edit]Patrik Arve \u2013 vocals, synthesizer, vocoder, bass, programming, percussion, keyboardsJoakim \u00c5hlund \u2013 bass guitar, programming, percussion, keyboards, backing vocals, guitarKlas \u00c5hlund \u2013 guitar, bass, programming, percussion, keyboards, backing vocalsFormer members[edit]Erik Olsson \u2013 drums, vibraphoneGlenn Sundell \u2013 drumsDiscography[edit]Albums[edit]Year\nAlbum\nBand name\n1993\nYou Are TeddybearsTeddybears STHLM1996\nI Can't Believe It's Teddybears STHLM2000\nRock 'n' Roll Highschool2004\nFresh2006\nSoft MachineTeddybears2010\nDevil's Music2016\nRock OnEPs[edit]Women in Pain (1991)Extra Pleasure (1993)Step on It (We Are The Best!)

He was appointed to the United States Military Academy from Massachusetts in 1835, but he left before graduation. He was made 2nd lieutenant in the 7th infantry in July 1839 and after serving in the second Seminole War resigned in November 1841. Subsequently, he was connected with George Ripley's utopian movement at Brook Farm, after which he met several transcendentalists including Orestes Brownson, Elizabeth Peabody and Ralph Waldo Emerson.[2] He studied theology at Harvard Divinity School, graduating in 1845. He was a pastor at a Unitarian church in Brookfield, Massachusetts before leaving to Europe.\nGreene returned in 1861 to serve in the American Civil War. Although a Democrat, he was a strong abolitionist and at the beginning of the Civil War became colonel of the 14th Massachusetts Infantry, afterward the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery. In 1862, while stationed with his regiment in Fairfax, Virginia he was recalled and assigned by General George McClellan to the command of an artillery brigade in Geneneral Amiel Weeks Whipple's division. He resigned his commission in October 1862 to continue his travels and writings.\n\nAccording to James J. Martin in Men Against the State, Greene did not become a \"full-fledged anarchist\" until the last decade of his life, but his writings show that by 1850 he had articulated a Christian mutualism, drawing heavily on the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's sometimes-antagonist Pierre Leroux (see Equality; 1849 and Mutual Banking; 1850), writing in The Radical Deficiency of Existing Circulating Medium (1857): The existing organization of credit is the daughter of hard money, begotten upon it incestuously by that insufficiency of circulating medium which results from laws making specie the sole legal tender. The immediate consequences of confused credit are want of confidence, loss of time, commercial frauds, fruitless and repeated applications for payment, complicated with irregular and ruinous expanses. The ultimate consequences are compositions, bad debts, expensive accommodation-loans, law-suits, insolvency, bankruptcy, separation of classes, hostility, hunger, extravagance, distress, riots, civil war, and, finally, revolution. The natural consequences of mutual banking are, first of all, the creation of order, and the definitive establishment of due organization in the social body, and, ultimately, the cure of all the evils. which flow from the present incoherence and disruption in the relations of production and commerce.In his radical, anonymously published pamphlet Equality, Greene had this to say about equality before the law: \"It is right that persons should be equal before the law: but when we have established equality before the law, our work is but half done. We ought to have EQUAL LAWS also\". His comments were directed towards the creation of corporations.[3]Greene was a fine mathematician and was versed in Hebrew literature and in Hebrew and Egyptian antiquities.\nMutual Banking[edit]Greene is best known for the works Mutual Banking[4] which proposed an interest-free banking system; and Transcendentalism, a critique of the New England philosophical school. In 1850 and 1851, he organized citizens of Brookfield, Warren and Ware, Massachusetts to petition the state's General Court for a charter to establish a mutual bank. Upon all the petitions and after hearing the arguments of the petitioners, the Committee on Banks and Banking reported simply: \"Leave to withdraw!\" (The Radical Deficiency of the Existing Circulating Medium, 1857). Similar attempts by the New England Labor Reform League in the 1870s met with similar results. Greene's mutualist banking ideas resembled those of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as well as the land banks of the colonial period. He had an important influence on Benjamin Tucker, the editor of the anarchist journal Liberty.\nDeath[edit]Greene spent his final days in Somerset, England. His remains were transported to Boston to be buried at Forest Hills, Roxbury (Jamaica Plain).[5]Noted works[edit]Mutual Banking.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RE_(complexity)", "labels": "random", "title": "RE (complexity)", "text": "In computability theory and computational complexity theory, RE (recursively enumerable) is the class of decision problems for which a 'yes' answer can be verified by a Turing machine in a finite amount of time.[1] Informally, it means that if the answer to a problem instance is 'yes', then there is some procedure which takes finite time to determine this, and this procedure never falsely reports 'yes' when the true answer is 'no'. However, when the true answer is 'no', the procedure is not required to halt; it may go into an \"infinite loop\" for some 'no' cases. Such a procedure is sometimes called a semi-algorithm, to distinguish it from an algorithm, defined as a complete solution to a decision problem.[2]Equivalently, RE is the class of decision problems for which a Turing machine can list all the 'yes' instances, one by one (this is what 'enumerable' means).\nEach member of RE is a recursively enumerable set and therefore a Diophantine set.\nSimilarly, co-RE is the set of all languages that are complements of a language in RE.  In a sense, co-RE contains languages of which membership can be disproved in a finite amount of time, but proving membership might take forever.\nContents1Relations to other classes2RE-complete3co-RE-complete4See also5References\n\nRelations to other classes[edit]The set of recursive languages (R) is a subset of both RE and co-RE.[3] In fact, it is the intersection of those two classes, because we can decide any problem for which there exists a recogniser and also a co-recogniser by simply interleaving them until one obtains a result. Therefore:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            RE\n          \n        \n        \u2229\n        \n          \n            co-RE\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{R}}={\\mbox{RE}}\\cap {\\mbox{co-RE}}}\n  .Conversely,the set of languages which are neither RE nor co-RE is known as NRNC. These are the set of languages for which neither membership nor non-membership can be proven in a finite amount of time, and contain all other languages which are not in either RE or co-RE. That is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            NRNC\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            ALL\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        (\n        \n          \n            RE\n          \n        \n        \u222a\n        \n          \n            co-RE\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mbox{NRNC}}={\\mbox{ALL}}-({\\mbox{RE}}\\cup {\\mbox{co-RE}})}\n  .Not only are these problems undecidable, but neither they nor their compliment are enumerable.\nRE-complete[edit]RE-complete is the set of decision problems that are complete for RE. In a sense, these are the \"hardest\" recursively enumerable problems. Generally, no constraint is placed on the reductions used except that they must be many-one reductions.\nExamples of RE-complete problems:\nHalting problem: Whether a program given a finite input finishes running or will run forever.By Rice's Theorem, deciding membership in any nontrivial subset of the set of recursive functions is RE-hard. It will be complete whenever the set is recursively enumerable.John Myhill\u00a0(1955)[4] has proven that all creative sets are RE-complete.The uniform word problem for groups or semigroups. [Indeed, the word problem for some individual groups is RE-complete.]Deciding membership in a general unrestrictedformal grammar. [Again, certain individual grammars have RE-complete membership problem.]The validity problem for first-order logic.Post correspondence problem: Given a finite set of strings, determine if there is a string that can be factored into a composition of the strings (allowing repeats) in two different ways.Determining if a Diophantine equation has any integer solutions.co-RE-complete[edit]co-RE-complete is the set of decision problems that are complete for co-RE. In a sense, these are the complements of the hardest recursively enumerable problems.\nExamples of co-RE-complete problems: \nThe Domino Problem for Wang tiles.The satisfiability problem for first-order logicSee also[edit]Knuth\u2013Bendix completion algorithmList of undecidable problemsPolymorphic recursionRisch algorithmSemidecidabilityReferences[edit]^Complexity Zoo: Class RE^Korfhage, Robert R.

A method of solution will be called a semi-algorithm for [a problem] P on [a device] M if the solution to P (if one exists) appears after the performance of finitely many steps. A semi-algorithm will be called an algorithm if, in addition, whenever the problem has no solution the method enables the device to determine this after a finite number of steps and halts..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}^Complexity Zoo: Class co-RE^Myhill, John (1955), \"Creative sets\", Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik, 1 (2): 97\u2013108, doi:10.1002/malq.19550010205, MR\u00a00071379.vteImportant complexity classes (more)Considered feasibleDLOGTIMEAC0ACC0TC0LSLRLNLNCSCCCPP-completeZPPRPBPPBQPAPXSuspected infeasibleUPNPNP-completeNP-hardco-NPco-NP-completeAMQMAPH\u2295PPP\u266fP\u266fP-completeIPPSPACEPSPACE-completeConsidered infeasibleEXPTIMENEXPTIMEEXPSPACE2-EXPTIMEELEMENTARYPRRREALLClass hierarchiesPolynomial hierarchyExponential hierarchyGrzegorczyk hierarchyArithmetical hierarchyBoolean hierarchyFamilies of classesDTIMENTIMEDSPACENSPACEProbabilistically checkable proofInteractive proof system\n\n", "tags": ["en.wikipedia.org", "wiki", "re", "complexity"]}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree_discography", "labels": "random", "title": "Porcupine Tree discography", "text": "Porcupine Tree discographyPorcupine Tree performing live at Krak\u00f3w, Poland on 7 July 2007.Studio albums10Live albums10Compilation albums6Video albums2EPs6Singles11Demo tapes3Promotional9Music videos11The following is a listing of officially released works by the English band Porcupine Tree. The band has released ten major studio albums, as well as many EPs, limited editions, and revamped material.\nAt the time Steven Wilson was going to sign to the Delerium label, he owned a lot of material recorded during the mid- and later '80s that he had recorded subsequently on three demo tapes - Tarquin's Seaweed Farm, Love, Death & Mussolini and The Nostalgia Factory. He sent copies of those tapes to people he felt would be interested in the recordings, asking them to spread the word. Delerium originally intended to release all of that material in a double debut album, but Wilson decided to just pick the songs he considered the best ones. These songs were mastered to make Porcupine Tree's first studio album, On the Sunday of Life... (1991); all of the leftover tracks would be later released on a compilation album called Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994).\nRichard Barbieri and Colin Edwin met Steven Wilson to play on a few songs he was working on. Again, there was a number of songs written that would perfectly fit on a double album, but one of these songs saw the light prior to the release of their second studio album on the Voyage 34 (1992) single, thereafter followed by Voyage 34: Remixes (1993), and the other material ended up on the Staircase Infinities (1994) EP. Finally, ten tracks were chosen for their next studio album, Up the Downstair (1993), which Melody Maker described as \"a psychedelic masterpiece\".[1] At the end of 1993, Chris Maitland joined the band for live shows and would later record some drums and percussions for three songs of Porcupine Tree's third studio album, The Sky Moves Sideways (1995), an album that made the press refer them as the \"Pink Floyd of the nineties\". They did not record as a full band until Signify (1996), the first Porcupine Tree album to be performed entirely by the four members. It contained shorter compositions and less improvisation than its predecessors.\nThe next album was delayed for almost three years as the band was looking for a new record label after finishing their deal with Delerium. In the meantime, they launched Metanoia (1998), a compilation of improvisations recorded during the Signify sessions, some of which were later shaped into songs. Finally, they signed to Snapper/K-Scope and the album Stupid Dream (1999) was issued. The album was a departure in style from all their previous works, in favour a more song-oriented direction, as a consequence this alienated some older fans but brought a lot of new ones. Its follow-up, Lightbulb Sun (2000), assured the fan base and solidified the ground of its predecessor. For this one, they worked with Dave Gregory of XTC, who provided string arrangements. A collection of EP tracks and out-takes from the previous two albums was launched a year after under the title of Recordings (2001).\nIn Absentia (2002) became one of their most successful works, remaining a favourite to many fans, charting in many European countries and selling over 100,000 copies in its first year of release.[2]Deadwing (2005) appeared the Billboard chart at number 132 of the Billboard 200[3] (which was the first entry the band achieved on the Billboard chart) and was voted the second-best album of 2005 in Sound & Vision, the most widely distributed US magazine in the field of home electronics and entertainment.[4]Porcupine Tree's next studio album, Fear of a Blank Planet (2007), debuted at number 59 on the Billboard 200,[5] won the Album of the Year award for the 2007 edition of the Classic Rock magazine awards,[6] and was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Surround Sound Album category.[7] The album features collaborations with Rush's guitarist Alex Lifeson and King Crimson's Robert Fripp. The title being a play on words relating to Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet album.\nOn 2007 they collaborated with Yoko Ono on the song \"Death of Samantha\", in Ono's remix album Yes, I'm a Witch.\nIn September 2007, they released Nil Recurring, an EP of four leftover tracks from the recording sessions for Fear of a Blank Planet. It was released on Transmission, the band's own record label as a limited edition of 5000 copies that did not take long to sell out through the band's online store, Burning Shed, forcing the band to keep printing more copies. Nevertheless, the EP was reissued on 18 February 2008 on Peaceville Records.[8]An in-store appearance at Park Avenue CDs in Orlando, Florida from 4 October 2007, was recorded and released on CD under the name of We Lost the Skyline.[9] The title is a reference to the lyrics on \"The Sky Moves Sideways (Phase One)\". The album was released on vinyl on 21 March 2008[10] and is the first official acoustic live record to be officially released by the band.\nA live album from the Fear of a Blank Planet tour, Ilosaarirock, was released in March 2009. It was recorded from their performance at the Ilosaarirock Festival on 14 July 2007. However, this album was only released to members of the Residents of a Blank Planet ticketing club.\nOn 15 September 2009, the band's tenth studio album was released, titled The Incident, the title track being one solid 55 minute epic. It quickly became the best selling Porcupine Tree album in the world charts to date.\nAnother live album from the Fear of a Blank Planet tour, Atlanta, was released in June 2010 in order to help raise funds for Mick Karn's treatment for cancer.[11]Contents1Albums1.1Studio albums1.2Live albums1.3Compilation albums2Extended plays3Demo tapes4Singles5Promotional singles6Videos6.1Video albums6.2Music

replaced by the track \"Out\" (from 1987) on the vinyl edition. The version of \"Radioactive Toy\" here is the original cassette version as opposed to the re-recorded and extended version on On the Sunday of Life.... \"Mute\" is a newer mix to the one on the cassette. \"An Empty Box\" had not appeared on either cassette but is another recording from the same period. Note that the vinyl edition corrects some factual errors and therefore dates some of the material back to 1984.b. ^ Most of these tracks appeared either on the album On the Sunday of Life... or the limited edition CD Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape. However, for the CD issue tracks 3 and 4/5 were retitled \"Third Eye Surfer\" and \"On the Sunday of Life...\" respectively. Also the version of \"Mute\" here is an earlier mix.c. ^ 40-minute tape private pressing of only 10 copies. Contains 7 tracks later to appear on The Nostalgia Factory, plus \"Out\" (later included on the vinyl edition of Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape) and the elsewhere unavailable \"It Will Rain for a Million Years\" (a completely different track to the one with the same title included on On the Sunday of Life...)d. ^ Most of these tracks appeared either on the album On the Sunday of Life... or the limited edition CD Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape. \"Colours Dance Angels Kiss\" and \"Hokey Cokey\" were later retitled \"Track 11\" and \"Execution of the Will of the Marquis de Sade\" respectively. \"The Nostalgia Factory\" is an earlier version to that on On the Sunday of Life... and \"Queen Quotes Crowley\" and \"This Long Silence\" are both about a minute longer than the versions later released on CD. An edit of the track \"Sinatra Rape Scene\" appears on Up the Downstair as \"Monuments Burn into Moments\".e. ^ Full show from the Deadwing tour filmed at Park West, Chicago in October 2005, edited by Lasse Hoile, with the soundtrack mixed in stereo and 5.1 surround sound, live performances of \"Futile\" and \"Radioactive Toy\" from German TV show Rockpalast, the \"Lazarus\" promo clip, the live films used during the show for \"Start of Something Beautiful\", \"Halo\", and \"Mother and Child Divided\", Gavin Harrison's \"Cymbal Song\", and a photo gallery.f. ^ A special edition has been made available in April, with a regular version following in May. Anesthetize was filmed live over 2 nights in Tilburg, The Netherlands in October 2008, at the end of the Fear of a Blank Planet tour. The 130-minute live film includes a complete performance of the Blank Planet album and 11 other tracks, and was directed and edited by Lasse Hoile on high definition cameras, with the soundtrack mixed into stereo and 5.1 sound. The special edition was released in the form of a cloth bound hard back 120 page book (as per The Incident and Insurgentes deluxe versions) featuring live photography of the band taken over the last 5 years. The book includes both a DVD and a much higher quality Blu-ray disc version of the film, as well as 2 audio CDs of the soundtrack including one bonus track not featured in the film. The book and audio CDs are not included with the standard retail versions of the Blu-ray/DVD.References[edit]^\"Porcupine Tree's Digital Releases\". Archived from the original on 11 May 2008.

Murray High School is one of the smallest high schools in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area with 1,465 students enrolled in the 2016\u201317 school year. The school enrolls students in grades 10\u201312.[citation needed] The school's mascot is the Spartan, and the school colors are orange and black. Murray High is a 5-A school in Utah's 6 Division high school sports leagues (1A being the smallest, and 6A being the largest).  The Disney Channel reality show High School Musical: Get in the Picture was shot on the Murray High campus in 2008,[2] and American Idol season 7 runner-up David Archuleta attended the school.[3] The school also offers the highest number of Salt Lake Community College Concurrent Enrollment classes in the state of Utah.[4]Contents1Building history2Academics3Going green4Controversy5Films and other productions shot at Murray6Sports state titles7Sports national titles8Notable alumni9References10External links\n\nBuilding history[edit]This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (March 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Murray High School was originally located on the east side of State Street at the current Hillcrest Junior High location, another Murray City School District School, at 126 East 5300 South Murray, UT. From 1916-54 Murray Junior High was named Murray High and Junior High. It was rebuilt and moved across to the west side of State Street in 1954.[5]Academics[edit]Salt Lake Community College Concurrent Enrollment offers over 120 classes which students can take and earn SLCC credit and also in-state college credit. Murray High ranks #1 in the state for the number of SLCC (Salt Lake Community College) associate degrees earned by high school seniors.[6]Murray High School has historically been the venue for the Salt Lake Region Solo and Ensemble. It has also been the venue for the State Jazz Ensemble. Both programs allow students from all over the state to compete and attend clinics to improve their playing. This status as host for the Region Instrumental Solo and Ensemble has been postponed due to the battle with cancer, and later passing, of Murray High's beloved director of instrumental music, Rob Wilson.In 2008 the Murray High School Advanced Culinary Arts students were awarded the title of \"Best New School\"  in the ProStart State Culinary Competition.Murray High School will be one of the few schools in Utah piloting the Utah State Office of Education U-PASS & criterion-referenced tests (CRTs) online. The school has received $100,000 to purchase new laptops and upgrade current computers. The administration of Spring 2008 criterion-referenced tests (CRTs) through computer-based testing (CBT) was performed through Pearson\u2019s assessment systems.[7] In recent years, SAGE testing has taken over the role that CRT testing once held in the school.Graduation rate is 95% (as of 2009).[6]Murray has historically done well in a variety of academic competitions. In 2015 they came in second place at the Utah Academic Olympiad's trivia bowl. They have also had strong performance in the Utah Sterling Scholar competitions, with several students from the school generally making it to the state-level competition. The only statewide winner in recent memory is Max Adams, who won the State Sterling Scholar competition in Business and Marketing.[8]Historically, Murray has achieved high scores in standardized testing, especially the PSAT and the ACT. Several students each year generally do well enough on the PSAT to get State National Merit Scholar Status. Murray has also had two students achieve perfect scores on the ACT in the last decade, Max Adams (see Sterling Scholar above) in 2014 and Peter Rosen in 2013.[9]Going green[edit]At the beginning of the 2007-2008 year, administrators, along with MHS's Environmental Club, started a program to save energy and money. Adjustments at the school, and other schools and offices in the district,  included changes to the thermostats, and turning off running water in the restrooms and unplugging machines during weekends and long breaks. This has caused difficulties for the instrumental music programs at Murray High, since instruments can sustain harm when temperatures are allowed to drop drastically over long school breaks. Recycling bins have been placed throughout the school. Students are sent to detention if they are found to have wasted excessive amounts of water.[10] Since its beginnings, the district has saved $405,000, all of which went into teachers' budgets. It is projected that in four years the district will have saved one million dollars, or a twenty percent savings per month.[11]Controversy[edit]In 2004, Murray High School prohibited same-sex students from participating in the promenade of their prom. Press coverage noted the similarity to Aaron Fricke vs. Richard B.

Jackie finds an ill animal called a bushbaby, whereupon she adopts him, calls him Murphy, and nurses him back to health. Murphy, Jackie, her family and their friends go on many adventures involving wild animals, poachers and more. When her father loses his job, the family prepares to return to England where they came from. At Mombasa, right before they are about to leave, Jackie realizes that she has lost the papers for her pet bushbaby, Murphy. She leaves the ship heading for England and it sets sail without her. Luckily, she meets Tenbo, her father's loyal African assistant. Tenbo has been spying on the export warehouse of some poachers and is now being pursued by them. In addition, a manhunt for Tenbo has begun because people think he has kidnapped Jackie. They must cross the dangerous savannah to escape the poachers and police officers chasing them. Along the way, Jackie teaches the now domesticated Murphy to survive in the wild, so that, before she leaves, she can release him in his natural habitat.\nCharacters[edit]Main Characters[edit]Jacqueline Rhodes (\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30cc\u00b7\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba,Jakkur\u012bnu R\u014dzu)Voiced by: Maya OkamotoAKA Jackie (\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc,Jakk\u012b), is the main character of the series.

Romanian language lyrics were written by Liviu Deleanu. The song was recorded in 1937 by Silvian Florin and by Petre Alexandru. The song was later covered and re-arranged by numerous musicians in different languages. Most notable covers are by Les Paul, under the title \"Johnny Is the Boy for Me\" (1952) in English, by Edith Piaf (1953) and Vaya con Dios (1988) as \"Johnny, tu n'es pas un ange\" in French, and  by Zvonko Bogdan as \"Svaku \u017eenu volim ja\" (1988) in Serbo-Croatian.\nThe song was the cause of a long-lasting court battle between Stein and Paul over plagiarism charges. Stein eventually won the case.[1]Contents1Original Romanian version2Cover versions3References4External links\n\nOriginal Romanian version[edit]\"Sanie cu zurg\u0103l\u0103i\" was composed in 1936 by composer Richard Stein (1909-1992) especially for Maria T\u0103nase, who refused to sing it considering the song of low quality. The lyrics were written by Liviu Deleanu, Jewish-Romanian poet and playwright.[2]Subsequently, the song was recorded by Silvian Florin for His Master's Voice (cat. no. JB 163) and Radio Romania archives. It was also recorded the same year by Ionel Pascu, for less known label Pan (formerly Lifa, cat. No. P 9). On the cover of the original music sheet, which appeared in late 1937, the song was subtitled \"Cling, cling, cling\".[2]The modern version of the song, the best known today, was recorded in 1949 by folk singer Maria L\u0103t\u0103re\u021bu for Columbia Records. The chorus was added and some lyrics changed.[2]Cover versions[edit]In 1953, American jazz, country and blues guitarist Les Paul covered the Mary L\u0103t\u0103re\u0163u version of the song under the title \"Johnny Is the Boy for Me\". English language lyrics, not connected to the Romanian original, were written by English lyricist and singer Paddy Roberts and Belgian producer and songwriter Marcel Stellman. Vocals were provided by Mary Ford, Paul's wife.[2] Paul's version was recorded in 1953 for Capitol Records (cat. No. 2486).[2]Few months later, \"Johnny\" was heard by \u00c9dith Piaf, who recorded her cover of Paul's version in December 1953 for Columbia Records (cat. No. BF 596) with French lyrics under the title \"Johnny, tu n'es pas un ange\". French lyrics were written by Francis Lemarque (1917-2002). On the Piaf's record, the music was credited to Paul.[2]Stein subsequently become a lawyer and sued Paul for plagiarism in the 1950s. It was one of the first lawsuits for plagiarism in music. Stein won the case.[2]In 1988, Belgian band Vaya Con Dios recorded a cover of  Piaf's \"Johnny, tu n'es pas un ange\" in French on their debut album Vaya Con Dios. On the record, the song was attributed to \u00c9dith Piaf, Les Paul and Francis Lemarque. In July 2001, nine years after Stein's death, UCMR-ADA (Romanian Musical Performing and Mechanical Rights Society) sued Vaya Con Dios for plagiarism because the band paid royalties to Les Paul instead of Stein.[2][3][4]In 2010, the Israeli artist Yoni Eilat recorded a Yiddish cover of the song, \"Vint un fayer\" (Yiddish: \u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d8 \u05d0\u05d5\u05df \u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e2\u05e8\u200e), for his album \"Tzigayner Neshume\".\nReferences[edit]^\"Zici ca n-ai plagiat si, gata, ai scapat\" (in Romanian). 23 February 2007..mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}^ abcdefgh\"Povestea unui c\u00e2ntec \u2013 Sanie cu zurg\u0103l\u0103i\" (in Romanian).

Reference ligands (100%) were progesterone for the PR, testosterone for the AR, E2 for the ER, DEXA for the GR, aldosterone for the MR, DHT for SHBG, and cortisol for CBG.\nMechanism of action[edit]Spermatozoa are produced in the testes of males in a process called spermatogenesis. In order to render a man infertile, a hormone-based male contraceptive method must stop spermatogenesis by interrupting the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland. Even in low concentrations, trestolone is a potent inhibitor of the release of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).[4][3] In order for spermatogenesis to occur in the testes, both FSH and testosterone must be present. By inhibiting release of FSH, trestolone creates an endocrine environment in which conditions for spermatogenesis are not ideal.[4][3] Manufacture of sperm is further impaired by the suppression of LH, which in turn drastically curtails the production of testosterone.[4][3] Sufficient regular doses of trestolone cause severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia, and therefore infertility, in most men.[4][3] Trestolone-induced infertility has been found to be quickly reversible upon discontinuation.[4][3]When LH release is inhibited, the amount of testosterone made in the testes declines dramatically.[4][3] As a result of trestolone's gonadotropin-suppressing qualities, levels of serum testosterone fall sharply in men treated with sufficient amounts of the medication.[4][3] Testosterone is the main hormone responsible for maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics. Normally, inadequate testosterone levels cause undesirable effects, such as fatigue, loss of skeletal muscle mass, reduced libido, and weight gain. However, the androgenic and anabolic properties of trestolone largely ameliorate this problem.[4][3] Essentially, trestolone replaces testosterone's role as the primary male hormone in the body.[4][3]Pharmacokinetics[edit]The pharmacokinetic properties of trestolone, such as poor oral bioavailability and short elimination half-life, make it unsuitable for oral administration or long-term intramuscular injection.[19][20] As such, trestolone must be administered parenterally via a different and more practical route such as subcutaneous implant, transdermal patch, or topicalgel.[19]Trestolone acetate, a prodrug of trestolone, can be administered via intramuscular injection.[5]Chemistry[edit]See also: List of androgens/anabolic steroidsTrestolone, also known as 7\u03b1-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT) or as 7\u03b1-methylestr-4-en-17\u03b2-ol-3-one, is a syntheticestranesteroid and a derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone).[1] It is a modification of nandrolone with a methyl group at the C7\u03b1 position.[1] Closely related AAS include 7\u03b1-methyl-19-norandrostenedione (MENT dione, trestione) (an androgen prohormone of trestolone) and dimethandrolone (7\u03b1,11\u03b2-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) (the C11\u03b2 methylated derivative of trestolone), as well as mibolerone (7\u03b1,17\u03b1-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) and dimethyltrienolone (7\u03b1,17\u03b1-dimethyl-\u03b49,11-19-nortestosterone).[1] The progestintibolone (7\u03b1-methyl-17\u03b1-ethynyl-\u03b45(10)-19-nortestosterone) is also closely related to trestolone.[1]History[edit]Trestolone was first described in 1963.[8] However, it was not subsequently studied again until 1990.[9][21] Development of trestolone for potential use in male hormonal contraception and androgen replacement therapy was started by 1993, and continued thereafter.[4][10][3] No additional development appears to have been conducted since 2013.[3] Trestolone was developed by the Population Council, a non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to reproductive health..[3][11]Society and culture[edit]Generic names[edit]Trestolone is the generic name of the drug and its INN.[1] It is also commonly known as 7\u03b1-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT).[1][2][3]References[edit]^ abcdefghiJ.

The pharmacokinetic properties of MENT make it unsuitable for once-daily oral treatment or long-term injection; thus, administration by sc implant or by patch or gel is required (27). MENT showed a more rapid metabolic clearance rate than T in men and monkeys, probably due in part to its failure to bind SHBG (28). In monkeys, MENT acetate in subdermal implants was 10 times as potent as T in suppression of gonadotropin secretion and anabolic effects, but was only twice as potent in stimulating prostate growth (29).^Suvisaari J, Sundaram K, No\u00e9 G, Kumar N, Aguillaume C, Tsong YY, L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki P, Bardin CW (May 1997). \"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 7alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone after intramuscular administration in healthy men\".

Gorman is also a founding member of the Archaeology, Science and Heritage Council of For All Moonkind, Inc., a nonprofit organisation developing and seeking to implement an international convention to protect human cultural heritage in outer space.[4]Contents1Traditional archaeology2Space archaeology3Awards and Recognition4Publications5References\n\nTraditional archaeology[edit]Gorman graduated from The University of Melbourne in 1986 with a B.A. (Hons) before working as an archaeological consultant in the Indigenous heritage management sector. She returned to study in the late 1990s and obtained a Ph.D. from The University of New England in 2001.[5] Her doctoral thesis examined how archaeologists can identify tools used in body modification through wear and residue analysis.[6] After graduation, she continued working as a heritage consultant until receiving a permanent academic position at Flinders University in 2005. Gorman continues to work in the Indigenous heritage management sector on short-term contracts.\nSpace archaeology[edit]From an early age, Gorman wanted to be both an astrophysicist and an archaeologist.[7] While she ended up pursuing a career in archaeology, she has reconciled the two by turning her research focus onto the archaeology of space exploration, or simply, space archaeology (for the use of satellite imagery to examine archaeological sites and landscapes, see remote sensing). In 2003, she took part in the first conference session on space archaeology at the Fifth World Archaeological Congress with John Campbell and Beth Laura O'Leary.[8]Since the mid-2000s, she has produced a number of publications on space archaeology and is credited for pioneering the concept of space as a cultural landscape and the application of cultural significance assessment to \"space junk\".[9] Gorman not only explored \"Space Race\" that happened during the Cold War[10], she has also considered the contribution of Indigenous people to global space exploration and the archaeological signatures of this interaction.[11]Gorman's space archaeology research includes the oldest satellite still in orbit, Vanguard 1, the Woomera and Kourou terrestrial launch sites, and the Orroral Valley NASA Tracking Station. In 2013, Gorman received recognition for her work on the archaeology of space when she was invited to present at TEDx Sydney.[12]Gorman is a member of the faculty of the International Space University, an assessor for the Australian Research Council, and a member of numerous space and archaeology organisations including the Space Industry Association of Australia.[5] She writes regularly for The Conversation, where she details much of her space archaeology research for a general audience.[13] Her work has been included in the 2013 Science Online anthology[14] and the collection of Best Australian Science Writing from 2013 to 2017.\nIn 2019, Gorman published her first book on space archaeology entitled \"Dr Space Junk vs The Universe: Archaeology and the future\"[15] for which she was interviewed on the ABC's Conversations program[16].\nAwards and Recognition[edit]In 2016, Gorman was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.[17] In 2017 she was awarded the Bragg UNSW Press Prize for Science Writing for her essay \"Trace fossils: The silence of Ediacara, the shadow of uranium\".[18]Publications[edit].mw-parser-output .refbegin{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul{list-style-type:none;margin-left:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>dl>dd{margin-left:0;padding-left:3.2em;text-indent:-3.2em;list-style:none}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-100{font-size:100%}Gorman, A.

Although it is Murphy's first single release in 14 years, he has written several songs for other artists in the interim. Murphy and Chesney produced the album with Chesney's longtime producer, Buddy Cannon. Murphy told Rolling Stone Country that \"We took our time picking the songs from the get-go. We were under no pressure. We recorded and overdubbed at our own pace\".[1] According to MusicRow, Murphy was inspired to record an album after sending several songs that he had written to Chesney, who encouraged him to start recording again. The disc features eleven songs, all co-written by Murphy.[2] The track \"Winnebago\" previously appeared on Chesney's 2016 album Cosmic Hallelujah.[3]Commercial performance[edit]The album debuted as No. 35 on Billboard's Top Country Albums, and No. 20 on Independent Albums, selling 2,600 copies in the first week.[4][5] It has sold 5,900 copies in the United States as of June 2018.[6]Track listing[edit]\"Way Gone\" (D.

From uncertainty as the longitudinal momentum transfer gets small the particles wavelength will increase, if the wavelength becomes longer than the mean free path in the medium (the average distance between scattering sites) then the scatterings can no longer be treated as independent events, this is the LPM effect. The Bethe\u2013Heitler spectrum for multiple scattering induced radiation assumes that the scatterings are independent, the quantum interference between successive scatterings caused by the LPM effect leads to suppression of the radiation spectrum relative to that predicted by Bethe\u2013Heitler.\nThe suppression occurs in different parts of the emission spectrum, for quantum electrodynamics (QED) small photon energies are suppressed, and for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) large gluon energies are suppressed. In QED the rescattering of the high energy electron dominates the process, in QCD the emitted gluons carry color charge and interact with the medium also. Since the gluons are soft their rescattering will provide the dominant modification to the spectrum.\nLev Landau and Isaak Pomeranchuk showed that the formulas for bremsstrahlung and pair creation in matter which had been formulated by Hans Bethe and Walter Heitler (the Bethe\u2013Heitler formula) were inapplicable at high energy or high matter density. The effect of multiple Coulomb scattering by neighboring atoms reduces the cross sections for pair production and bremsstrahlung. Arkady Migdal developed a formula applicable at high energies or high matter densities which accounted for these effects.\nReferences[edit]^Aurenche, P.; Gelis, F.; Zaraket, H.

It is found only in a small region of the Andes in central Bolivia, where it lives in cloud forest at altitudes from 2600 to 3000 m.[3]Exceptionally small for its genus,[4]O. hucucha was first recognized as new when a specimen was caught in 1984 in the Siberia Cloud Forest in Bolivia's Cochabamba Department, near the border of Santa Cruz Department. It was recognized as an Oxymycterus by its long claws relative to other, sympatric small akodontine rodents.[5] Two other specimens caught nearby[6] in 1955 and 1979 were then recognized as pertaining to the same species; one had been misidentified as Akodon mimus.[5] In 1987, O. hucucha and another small Oxymycterus, O. hiska from Peru, were named and described in an American Museum Novitates paper by Flavio Hinojosa, Sydney Anderson, and James Patton.[4]O. hucucha's specific name is derived from hucucha, which means \"mouse\" in Quechua, the local Amerindian language in the region where the species is found.[6]It is similar in size to O. hiska, but slightly smaller, and the fur of the upperparts is more pale and reddish. Furthermore, the skull is narrower, the palate is longer, and the upper incisors are oriented more to the front, among other differences. Its coloration resembles that of some young O. inca, a larger Oxymycterus that occurs in the same region, but the latter have larger feet.[6]The IUCN lists its conservation status as \"endangered\" because it has a small distribution, its habitat is being destroyed, and it is not known from any protected areas.[1]References[edit]^ abDunnum et al., 2008^Musser and Carleton, 2005; Dunnum et al., 2008^Hinojosa et al., 1987, p. 15; Musser and Carleton, 2005^ abHinojosa et al., 1987, p. 1^ abHinojosa et al., 1987, p. 2^ abcHinojosa et al., 1987, p. 15Literature cited[edit]Dunnum, J., Vargas, J. and Bernal, N. 2008.

The ranch headquarters is located at Cow Springs, originally Ojo de Vaca.[1]History[edit]Ojo de Vaca was a watering place on the old trail between Janos, Chihuahua, Mexico to the Santa Ritacopper mines.  When Cooke's Mormon Battalion was searching for a wagon route between the Rio Grande and California, they intercepted the old Mexican road at this spring. From there they followed a course southwestward to Guadalupe Pass and the Janos - Fronteras Road they followed west to the San Pedro River, following it northward before turning west to Mescal Spring and Tucson, pioneering the route known as Cooke's Wagon Road.  By 1849, Cooke's road became the major southern route of the forty-niners during the California Gold Rush and Ojo de Vaca spring was one of the reliable watering places on what became the Southern Emigrant Trail.  Later Ojo de Vaca was a watering place on the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line.[2]  Subsequently the Butterfield Overland Mail built Ojo de Vaca Station as a stagecoach station at Ojo de Vaca, in New Mexico Territory.  It was located 14 miles northeast of Soldiers Farewell Station and 16 miles southwest of Miembre's River Station, later Mowry City, New Mexico.[3]  It remained an important stop on this route until the long distance stagecoach lines ended in the late 19th century.\nReferences[edit]^U.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: Cow Springs Ranch^Table of distances from Texas Almanac, 1859, Book, ca. 1859; digital images, (http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth123765/ accessed November 12, 2013), University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History, http://texashistory.unt.edu; crediting Texas State Historical Association, Denton, Texas^List of Stations from New York Times, October 14 1858, Itinerary of the RouteCoordinates: 32\u00b024\u203243\u2033N108\u00b010\u203243\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff32.41194\u00b0N 108.17861\u00b0W\ufeff / 32.41194; -108.17861This New Mexico state location article is a stub.

There, he played his first game in the Bundesliga on 28 August 1991, a 0\u20133 home loss against Stuttgarter Kickers; that would be his only appearance for the first team in three years.\nAfter helping FC St. Paulinarrowly miss out on promotion from the second division, Reinke signed with 1. FC Kaiserslautern, where he won his first trophies: in 1996, the Palatinate Forest side suffered top flight relegation but managed to winthe cup, 1\u20130 against Karlsruher SC.\nReinke and Kaiserslautern immediately promoted back, amazingly repeating the feat of winning the league the following year, with the player conceding 53 in 56 matches both seasons combined.\nDeemed surplus to requirements in the 2000 summer, Reinke spent the following three years abroad, starting in Greece with Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. then moving to Real Murcia after one year. With the Spaniards, he won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in the 2002\u201303 campaign as the club returned to La Liga; apart from only conceding 21 in 40 games[1] he still found the net, converting a penalty kick in a 2\u20131 home win over CD Numancia.[2]Aged 34, Reinke returned to his country, signing with SV Werder Bremen. In his first year the club won the double, and he did not miss one second of action in that and the following seasons. However, he would be eventually pushed to the bench by younger Tim Wiese (who also played at Kaiserslautern) and retired from the game at the end of 2006\u201307, aged 38, having accomplished the feat of being the first goalkeeper to win the German championship with two different clubs.\nReinke started his coaching career shortly after, briefly being in charge of Germany under-21s goalkeepers. In 2013, he signed for F.C. Hansa Rostock in the same predicament.[3]Honours[edit]Club[edit]Bundesliga: 1997\u201398, 2003\u201304DFB-Pokal: 1995\u201396, 2003\u201304DFB-Ligapokal: 2006; Runner-up 20042.

Though he became famous for his long novels of fantasy, he was also a newspaper journalist, photographer, short story writer, book reviewer, ecological consultant, and lecturer.\nThe Dune saga, set in the distant future, and taking place over millennia, deals with complex themes, such as human survival and evolution, ecology, and the intersection of religion, politics, and power. Dune is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time,[2] and the whole series is widely considered to be among the classics of the genre.\nContents1Biography1.1Early life1.2Dune1.3Success, family changes, and death1.4Criticism of government2Ideas and themes3Status and influence on science fiction4Bibliography4.1Posthumously published works5See also6References7Further reading8External links8.1Biography and criticism8.2Bibliography and works\n\nBiography[edit]Early life[edit]Frank Herbert was born on October 8, 1920, in Tacoma, Washington, to Frank Patrick Herbert Sr. and Eileen (McCarthy) Herbert. Because of a poor home environment, he ran away from home in 1938 to live with an aunt and uncle in Salem, Oregon.[3] He enrolled in high school at Salem High School (now North Salem High School), where he graduated the next year.[3] In 1939 he lied about his age to get his first newspaper job at the Glendale Star.[4] Herbert then returned to Salem in 1940 where he worked for the Oregon Statesman newspaper (now Statesman Journal) in a variety of positions, including photographer.[3]He served in the U.S. Navy's Seabees for six months as a photographer during World War II, then he was given a medical discharge. He married Flora Parkinson in San Pedro, California, in 1940. They had a daughter, Penny (b. February 16, 1942), but divorced in 1945.\nAfter the war, Herbert attended the University of Washington, where he met Beverly Ann Stuart at a creative writing class in 1946. They were the only students who had sold any work for publication; Herbert had sold two pulp adventure stories to magazines, the first to Esquire in 1945, and Stuart had sold a story to Modern Romance magazine. They married in Seattle, Washington on June 20, 1946, and had two sons, Brian Patrick Herbert (b. June 29, 1947, Seattle, Washington) and Bruce Calvin Herbert (b. June 26, 1951, Santa Rosa, California d. June 15, 1993, San Rafael, California, a professional photographer and gay rights activist.[5])\nIn 1949 Herbert and his wife moved to California to work on the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat. Here they befriended the psychologists Ralph and Irene Slattery. The Slatterys introduced Herbert to the work of several thinkers who would influence his writing, including Freud, Jung, Jaspers and Heidegger; they also familiarized Herbert with Zen Buddhism.[6]Herbert did not graduate from the university; according to his son Brian, he wanted to study only what interested him and so did not complete the required curriculum. He returned to journalism and worked at the Seattle Star and the Oregon Statesman. He was a writer and editor for the San Francisco Examiner's California Living magazine for a decade.\nIn a 1973 interview, Herbert stated that he had been reading science fiction \"about ten years\" before he\nbegan writing in the genre, and he listed his favorite authors as H. G. Wells, Robert A. Heinlein, Poul Anderson and Jack Vance.[7]Herbert's first science fiction story, \"Looking for Something\", was published in the April 1952 issue of Startling Stories, then a monthly edited by Samuel Mines. Three more of his stories appeared in 1954 issues of Astounding Science Fiction and Amazing Stories.[8] His career as a novelist began in 1955 with the serial publication of Under Pressure in Astounding from November 1955; afterward it was issued as a book by Doubleday, The Dragon in the Sea.[8] The story explored sanity and madness in the environment of a 21st-century submarine and predicted worldwide conflicts over oil consumption and production.[9] It was a critical success but not a major commercial one. During this time Herbert also worked as a speechwriter for Republican senator Guy Cordon.[10]Dune[edit]  The Oregon Dunes, near Florence, Oregon, served as an inspiration for the Dune saga.Herbert began researching Dune in 1959. He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when he was supposed to do a magazine article on sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to Dune.\nDune took six years of research and writing to complete and it was much longer than commercial science fiction of the time was supposed to be. Analog (the renamed Astounding, still edited by John W. Campbell) published it in two parts comprising eight installments, \"Dune World\" from December 1963 and \"Prophet of Dune\" in 1965.[8] It was then rejected by nearly twenty book publishers. One editor prophetically wrote, \"I might be making the mistake of the decade, but\u00a0...\".[11]Sterling E. Lanier, an editor of Chilton Book Company (known mainly for its auto-repair manuals) had read the Dune serials and offered a  $7,500 advance plus future royalties for the rights to publish them as a hardcover book.[12] Herbert rewrote much of his text.[13]Dune was soon a critical success.[11] It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965 and shared the Hugo Award in 1966 with ...And Call Me Conrad by Roger Zelazny.[14]Dune was the first major ecological science fiction novel, embracing a multitude of sweeping, interrelated themes and multiple character viewpoints, a method that ran through all Herbert's mature work.\nDune was not an immediate bestseller. By 1968 Herbert had made $20,000 from it, far more than most science fiction novels of the time were generating, but not enough to let him take up full-time writing. However, the publication of Dune did open doors for him. He was the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's education writer from 1969 to 1972 and lecturer in general studies and interdisciplinary studies at the University of Washington (1970\u20131972). He worked in Vietnam and Pakistan as a social and ecological consultant in 1972. In 1973 he was director-photographer of the television show The Tillers.[15].mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}A man is a fool not to put everything he has, at any given moment, into what he is creating. You're there now doing the thing on paper. You're not killing the goose, you're just producing an egg. So I don't worry about inspiration, or anything like that. It's a matter of just sitting down and working. I have never had the problem of a writing block. I've heard about it. I've felt reluctant to write on some days, for whole weeks, or sometimes even longer. I'd much rather go fishing, for example, or go sharpen pencils, or go swimming, or what not. But, later, coming back and reading what I have produced, I am unable to detect the difference between what came easily and when I had to sit down and say, \"Well, now it's writing time and now I'll write.\" There's no difference on paper between the two.[16]\u2014\u2009Frank HerbertBy the end of 1972, Herbert had retired from newspaper writing and become a full-time fiction writer. During the 1970s and 1980s, Herbert enjoyed considerable commercial success as an author. He divided his time between homes in Hawaii and Washington's Olympic Peninsula; his home in Port Townsend on the peninsula was intended to be an \"ecological demonstration project\".[17] During this time he wrote numerous books and pushed ecological and philosophical ideas. He continued his Dune saga, following it with Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, and God Emperor of Dune. Other highlights were The Dosadi Experiment, The Godmakers, The White Plague and the books he wrote in partnership with Bill Ransom: The Jesus Incident, The Lazarus Effect, and The Ascension Factor which were sequels to Destination: Void. He also helped launch the career of Terry Brooks with a very positive review of Brooks' first novel, The Sword of Shannara, in 1977.[18]Success, family changes, and death[edit]Herbert's change in fortune was shadowed by tragedy. In 1974, Beverly underwent an operation for cancer. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the surgery.[19] During this period, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California, in October 1978. In 1979, he met anthropologist James Funaro with whom he conceived the Contact Conference. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984, the same year that Heretics of Dune was published; in his afterword to 1985's Chapterhouse: Dune, Frank Herbert wrote a eulogy for her.\nIn 1983, British heavy metal band Iron Maiden requested permission from Herbert's publisher to name a song on their album Piece of Mind after Dune, but were told that the author had a strong distaste for their style of music. They instead titled the song \"To Tame a Land\".\n1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of David Lynch's film version of Dune. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the US, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.[13]After Beverly's death, Herbert married Theresa Shackleford in 1985, the year he published Chapterhouse: Dune, which tied up many of the saga's story threads. This would be Herbert's final single work (the collection Eye was published that year, and Man of Two Worlds was published in 1986). He died of a massive pulmonary embolism while recovering from surgery for pancreatic cancer on February 11, 1986, in Madison, Wisconsin, age 65.\nCriticism of government[edit]Herbert was a strong critic of the Soviet Union. He was a distant relative of the controversial Republican senator, Joseph McCarthy, whom he referred to as \"Cousin Joe.\" Herbert was appalled to learn of McCarthy's blacklisting of suspected Communists from working in certain careers and believed that he was endangering essential freedoms of citizens of the United States.[20] Herbert believed that governments lie to protect themselves and that, following the infamous Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon had unwittingly taught an important lesson in not trusting government.[21] Herbert also opposed American involvement in the US war in Vietnam. [22]In Chapterhouse: Dune, he wrote:[citation needed]All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a condition to which they are quickly addicted.\u2014\u2009Frank Herbert, Chapterhouse: DuneIdeas and themes[edit]\u201c\nI think science fiction does help, and it points in very interesting directions. It points in relativistic directions. It says that we have the imagination for these other opportunities, these other choices. We tend to tie ourselves down to limited choices. We say, \"Well, the only answer is\u00a0...\" or, \"If you would just\u00a0...\". Whatever follows these two statements narrows the choices right there. It gets the vision right down close to the ground so that you don't see anything happening outside. Humans tend not to see over a long range. Now we are required, in these generations, to have a longer range view of what we inflict on the world around us. This is where, I think, science fiction is helping. I don't think that the mere writing of such a book as Brave New World or 1984 prevents those things which are portrayed in those books from happening. But I do think they alert us to that possibility and make that possibility less likely. They make us aware that we may be going in that direction.[citation needed]\u201d\n\u2014\u200aFrank HerbertFrank Herbert used his science fiction novels to explore complex[23] ideas involving philosophy, religion, psychology, politics and ecology. The underlying thrust of his work was a fascination with the question of human survival and evolution. Herbert has attracted a sometimes fanatical fan base, many of whom have tried to read everything he wrote, fiction or non-fiction, and see Herbert as something of an authority on the subject matters of his books. Indeed, such was the devotion of some of his readers that Herbert was at times asked if he was founding a cult,[24] something he was very much against.\nThere are a number of key themes in Herbert's work:\nA concern with leadership. He explored the human tendency to slavishly follow charismatic leaders. He delved into both the flaws and potentials of bureaucracy and government.[9]Herbert was the first science fiction author to popularize ideas about ecology[25] and systems thinking.  He stressed the need for humans to think both systematically and long-term.[26]The relationship between religion, politics and power.[27]Human survival and evolution: Herbert writes of the Fremen, the Sardaukar, and the Dosadi, who are molded by their terrible living conditions into dangerous super races.[citation needed]Human possibilities and potential: Herbert offered Mentats, the Bene Gesserit and the Bene Tleilax as different visions of human potential.[citation needed]The nature of sanity and madness. Frank Herbert was interested in the work of Thomas Szasz and the anti-psychiatry movement. Often, Herbert poses the question, \"What is sane?\", and while there are clearly insane behaviors and psychopathies as evinced by characters (Piter De Vries for instance), it is often suggested that normal and abnormal are relative terms which humans are sometimes ill-equipped to apply to one another, especially on the basis of statistical regularity.[9]The possible effects and consequences of consciousness-altering chemicals, such as the spice in the Dune saga, as well as the \"Jaspers\" fungus in The Santaroga Barrier, and the Kelp in the Destination: Void sequence.[9]How language shapes thought. More specifically, Herbert was influenced by Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics.[28]Algis Budrys wrote that his knowledge of language and linguistics \"is worth at least one Ph.D. and the Chair of Philology at a good New England college\".[29]Sociobiology. How our instincts unconsciously influence our behavior and society.[citation needed]Learning, teaching, and thinking.[9]Frank Herbert refrained from offering his readers formulaic answers to many of the questions he explored.[9]Status and influence on science fiction[edit]Dune and the Dune saga constitute one of the world's best-selling science fiction series and novels; Dune in particular has received widespread critical acclaim, winning the Nebula Award in 1965 and sharing the Hugo Award in 1966, and is frequently considered one of the best science fiction novels ever, if not the best.[30]Locus subscribers voted it the all-time best SF novel in 1975, again in 1987, and the best \"before 1990\" in 1998.[31]Dune is considered a landmark novel for a number of reasons:\nDune is a landmark of soft science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the future of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[32][33]Dune was the first major ecological science fiction novel. Frank Herbert was a great popularizer of scientific ideas; many of his fans credit Frank Herbert for introducing them to philosophy and psychology. In Dune he helped popularize the term ecology and some of the field's concepts, vividly imparting a sense of planetary awareness.[citation needed] Gerald Jonas explains in The New York Times Book Review: \"So completely did Mr. Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that Dune became the standard for a new subgenre of 'ecological' science fiction.\" As popularity of Dune rose, Herbert embarked on a lecture tour of college campuses, explaining how the environmental concerns of Dune's inhabitants were analogous to our own.[citation needed]Dune is considered an epic example of literary world-building. The Library Journal reports that \"Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to fantasy\". Arthur C. Clarke is quoted as making a similar statement on the back cover of a paper edition of Dune.[34] Frank Herbert imagined every facet of his creation. He lovingly included glossaries, quotes, documents, and histories, to bring his universe alive to his readers. No science fiction novel before it had so vividly realized life on another world.[9]Herbert never again equalled the critical acclaim he received for Dune. Neither his sequels to Dune nor any of his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although almost all of them were New York Times Best Sellers.[35]Malcolm Edwards in the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote:\nMuch of Herbert's work makes difficult reading. His ideas were genuinely developed concepts, not merely decorative notions, but they were sometimes embodied in excessively complicated plots and articulated in prose which did not always match the level of thinking [...] His best novels, however, were the work of a speculative intellect with few rivals in modern science fiction.[36]The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Herbert in 2006.[35][37][38]California State University, Fullerton's Pollack Library has several of Herbert's draft manuscripts of Dune and other works, with the author's notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.[39]Bibliography[edit]Main article: Frank Herbert bibliographyPosthumously published works[edit]Beginning in 2012, Herbert's estate and WordFire Press have released four previously unpublished novels in e-book and paperback formats: High-Opp (2012),[40]Angels' Fall (2013),[41]A Game of Authors (2013),[42] and A Thorn in the Bush (2014).[43]In recent years, Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson have added to the Dune franchise, using notes left behind by Frank Herbert and discovered over a decade after his death. Brian Herbert and Anderson have written two prequel trilogies (Prelude to Dune and Legends of Dune) exploring the history of the Dune universe before the events within Dune, as well as two post-Chapterhouse Dune novels that complete the original series (Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune) based on Frank Herbert's own Dune 7 outline.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]See also[edit]Science fiction portal \nReferences[edit]^\"Google Books - Dune\".

Abel Mikaelsen)A mass shooting occurred during early morning on New Years Day on January 1, 1990 during a party in Narsaq of the municipality of Kujalleq in Greenland of the Kingdom of Denmark. Seven people were killed and one was critically wounded in the worst mass shooting in the autonomous constituent country's history.[1]Contents1Background2Shooting3Aftermath4See also5References\n\nBackground[edit]Greenland has a high murder rate and the highest suicide rate in the world.[2] The country has no closed prisons so people who commit serious crimes are often known to walk free unless they are transported to a Danish prison or another facility.[3]Narsaq, with around 2,000 people of mostly Inuit ethnicity, is one of the largest towns in Greenland. The town contains one small hospital and a police station. Greenland had 18 homicides in 1989.\nShooting[edit]  Narsaq skyline from Qaaqarsuaq mountain.During a New Years party after the turn of the year 1989 to 1990, student Abel Klemmensen got involved in a dispute with his best friend for taking the side of a girl he was angry at. Feeling betrayed, he then went home and later returned to the party with a semiautomatic rifle with the intention to kill all attendants of the party and commit suicide afterwards. The disgruntled perpetrator then opened fire in a boarding house complex in Ungbo, being used as a club, and aimed for people's heads.\nIn two rooms on the first floor he shot three women and four men, including his own brother, who was wounded by a shot through the cheek. While walking downstairs to the living room he shot a fourth woman. He had fired eleven rounds and hit all of his victims in the head.\nThree men and two women died at the scene, while two more women died in the local hospital. All seven died from shots to the head, specifically the face, while another victim was critically wounded with another head or face injury from the weapon. After the tragedy, Klemmensen then went home to sleep, where he was later arrested by police and placed in custody.[4]Aftermath[edit]The man in custody was identified as an 18-year-old student who confessed to the killings, said police inspector Lars Heilman. The suspect's name was later released as Abel Klemmensen (ca. 1971). The crime scene was described as \"gruesome\" by the police. A team of police forensic scientists traveled to Narsaq from Copenhagen to investigate the killings, but were delayed by heavy snowfall. Those killed, all Inuit, were identified only as three men, aged 18, 33 and 34, and four women, aged 18, 19, 26 and 29. The wounded man was only identified as a \"22-year-old man in stable condition with head wounds\".[5]Klemmensen was later diagnosed as suffering from narcissistic personality disorder and was sentenced to indefinite detention at a psychiatric institution in March 1991. He is imprisoned in Herstedvester.\nSee also[edit]List of rampage killers (Americas)References[edit]^\"WORLD\u00a0: 7 Die in Greenland's Bloodiest Mass Shooting; Suspect Held - latimes\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_S._Spalding", "labels": "random", "title": "Henry S. Spalding", "text": "  Henry S Spalding, S.J.Henry Stanislaus Spalding, S.J. (1865\u20131934) was the author of several books about medical ethics but was best known for his series of adventure books for boys.  His stories incorporated elements of the Catholic faith as well as history and outdoor adventure.\nContents1Early life2Jesuit priest and educator3Catholic author4Illness and death5Works5.1Articles6References7External links\n\nEarly life[edit]Henry Stanislaus Spalding was born January 10, 1865, in Bardstown, Kentucky.[1][2]  The Spalding family was staunchly Catholic, having been among the early English settlers of the colony of Maryland, and with other families had settled in the Bardstown/Rolling Fork area, which later grew into the first Catholic diocese west of the Appalachians.[3]  Among the descendants of these original Spalding settlers were the Most Reverend Martin John Spalding, archbishop of Baltimore from 1864 to 1872, and John Lancaster Spalding, who was bishop of Peoria from 1877 to 1908.  Though not as illustrious as these two, among Henry's siblings were a Dominican priest and four Dominican nuns.[1]Jesuit priest and educator[edit]Spalding entered the Jesuit novitiate at Florissant, Missouri, on August 7, 1884, and spent five years teaching at Marquette College (now Marquette University) from 1888 to 1893 before completing his studies for the priesthood at St. Louis University and Woodstock College.[1][2]  Here he was ordained in 1899 by Cardinal James Gibbons.  He later returned to Marquette, where he held the post of Prefect of Studies and Discipline from 1903 to 1908.  During this time, with then-president of Marquette, Alexander Burrowes, he helped establish the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy (now the Medical College of Wisconsin), of which he subsequently was appointed regent.[1][4]In 1911 Spalding worked with Burrowes once more to establish the Loyola University School of Medicine (now the Stritch School of Medicine), where he remained Regent until 1917.[5]  Both here and at Marquette, the establishment of these medical schools involved mergers with secular schools, and coming under the authority of these Catholic institutions meant that certain subjects that contradicted Catholic teaching had to be avoided.[4]  Perhaps as a result of this, Spalding began teaching medical ethics at this time, produced several textbooks on the subject, and would later develop a specialty in Sociology, crowning his career with a textbook on the subject, in collaboration with fellow Jesuit Herbert Muntsch.[6]Catholic author[edit]Spalding began publishing stories for boys in 1901, beginning with The Cave of the Beech Fork and following it in 1903 with The Sheriff of the Beech Fork.  Both stories are set in 1815 in Spalding's hometown of Bardstown, Kentucky, and mention actual figures such as William Byrne and Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget, both of whom figured heavily in the life of his relative, Archbishop Martin John Spalding.[3]  The historical setting and the outdoors adventures in these books prompted Maurice Francis Egan to say of them, \"In The Cave by the Beech Fork a new genre is credited in American Catholic Literature...all the fresh air books provided for boys had hitherto been written by non-Catholics...\"[7]Spalding's special study of Jacques Marquette formed the basis for his next historical novels, The Race for Copper Island and The Marks of the Bear Claws, and his appointment as Knights of Columbus chaplain to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, Florida during World War I[8] gave him the impetus to write two books set in the Everglades, Held in the Everglades and Signals from the Bay Tree.  And having descended from early Maryland settlers, he prepared for the Maryland Tercentenary in 1934 by writing Catholic Colonial Maryland as well as the historical novel Arrows of Iron.[1]Illness and death[edit]In 1932 Spalding was diagnosed with pernicious anemia and was not expected to live, but he recovered and was able to celebrate his Golden Jubilee on August 12, 1934.  Early that fall, however, the anemia returned, and as he worsened, he was given last rites and was visited by several of his siblings one last time before slipping into a coma and passing away on December 27, 1934.[1]Works[edit]\n\n \nThe Cave by the Beech Fork (1901)The Sheriff of the Beech Fork (1903)The Race for Copper Island (1905)The Marks of the Bear Claws (1908)The Old Mill on the Withrose (1910)Finding the Great River: the Story of Father Marquette (1911)The Sugar Camp and After (1912)The Camp by Copper River (1915)At the Foot of the Sand Hills (1917)Held in the Everglades (1919)Talks to nurses: the ethics of nursing (1920)Moral principles and medical practice: the basis of medical jurisprudence by Charles Coppens, Revised and expanded by Henry S.

She graduated in 1941 from the K\u00f6nigin-Luise-Schule in Berlin-Friedenau, and took a degree in German literature, history, and philosophy, followed by a doctorate on 20 April 1945, at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University (today's Humboldt University in Berlin).  Her thesis was on German poet Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer.[1]From 1973 to 1980 she taught at the Institute of Journalism at the Free University of Berlin.  A year before her death she was a juror at the Ingeborg Bachmann Competition in Klagenfurt.\nShe married her childhood sweetheart, Bernhard Drewitz, by whom she had three daughters.  She died in Berlin, aged 63, of complications of cancer.[2]Writings[edit]As a writer, she was interested in the Enlightenment and addressed Germany's post-war history and the past and present social history of women.  According to Knaurs Lexikon der Weltliteratur ((in German) \"Knaur's Lexicon of World Literature\"), third edition of 1995, she \"made in her literary work, the abandonment of modern man and his inability to address his neighbour, as well as the problem of the individuality of life.  Problems in women and employment are at the heart of her work.\"\nHer drama Alle Tore waren bewacht (All gates were guarded\"), which premiered in 1955, was the first German play to address conditions in concentration camps.[2]Her most successful novel was Gestern war heute: Hundert Jahre Gegenwart (Yesterday was today: A hundred years of presence) (1978), that dealt with three generations of women in the 20th century.\nNovels[edit]Der Ansto\u00df.

I started listening to him daily and singing what I heard.\"[40] Singer The-Dream has inspired him becoming a lyricist, \"I started listening to The-Dream a lot. That\u2019s when I really got into writing songs. I like the way he put lyrics and makes his songs. So I was like, all right, and I just started writing. That's when I started wanting to be a songwriter. I never really wanted to be an artist. I just really wanted to write songs. But of course I can't get placement unless I demo the songs.\"[41]His other influences include R. Kelly, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown and Drake.[42][43] In addition, Tiller listed Jazmine Sullivan, Usher, Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J.

He was the eldest son of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, sometime regent of Scotland.  He was of royal descent, and at times was third or fourth in succession to the Scottish crown; several royal marriages were proposed for him. He went to France with Mary, Queen of Scots, and commanded the Scots Guards. After returning to Scotland, he became a leader of the Protestant party against Mary and her French supporters, but went insane in 1562 and was confined in seclusion for the rest of his life.\nContents1Ancestry and family2Regent Arran's marriage plans3In France4Possible French brides5Queen Elizabeth6\"Monsieur de Beaufort\"7Back in Scotland8Lady Catherine Grey9Mary again10Valiant and Stout in the Cause11Long twilight12Ancestors13Further reading14Footnotes\n\nAncestry and family[edit]James was born in 1532 or 1536.[1] His father, James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, was the grandson of Mary Stewart, eldest daughter of James II of Scotland. At this time the second Earl of Arran was, after King James V, the most senior, legitimate male descendant of King James II and, so the elder Arran was heir presumptive for much of King James V's reign and the future 3rd Earl of Arran was next in succession after him.\nThrough his mother Margaret Douglas he was descended from James IV through an illegitimate daughter, and Joan of Scotland, daughter of James I.\nIn 1542, James and his father were displaced by the birth of James V's daughter, Mary (the future Mary, Queen of Scots) - until James V died only six days later. The elder Arran became regent for the baby queen.\nRegent Arran's marriage plans[edit]The Regent proposed various royal marriages for his son, who was after all second in line for the crown.\nIn March 1543, James V's widow, Mary of Guise told the English ambassador Ralph Sadler that the Regent  \"mindeth to marry\" her daughter Queen Mary to his son, something she was anxious to avoid.[2] In December 1543, French envoys heard that the Regent wanted to marry James to Henry VIII of England's daughter Lady Elizabeth (later Elizabeth I).[3] This may have been offered by Henry himself as a price of the earl's allegiance, but nothing came of the proposal either.[4]Henry wanted to marry the baby queen to his son Edward. The Regent was a Protestant, and initially supported this in public, despite widespread opposition in Scotland. Then in 1543 Arran became Catholic and joined the pro-French faction of Cardinal Beaton. Henry responded with the \"Rough Wooing\", nine years of war to make Scotland accept the English marriage.\nIn October 1544, James was taken to St Andrews Castle, where he was Cardinal Beaton's guest and a pledge for the alliance of the Regent and the Cardinal.[5]The Regent still wanted to marry Mary to James. His half-brother, John, Abbot of Paisley, met with Lord Somerville and the Earl of Angus on 28 October 1545, to get their support. Somerville's son John wrote to Mary of Guise that they would not be persuaded.[6]Alexander Crichton of Brunstane and a diplomat in France, Johannes Sturm, also sent warnings of this marriage proposal to England. Sturm realised the marriage would hinder Anglo-French peace treaty negotiations.[7] James remained in the Cardinal's custody. In February 1546 he was sent a book of Latin exercises and a copy of Aesop's Fables.[8]In 1546, a Protestant band seized St Andrews Castle and murdered the Cardinal. James was held prisoner. The Regent besieged St Andrews; the Protestants offered to give James to Henry VIII, in return for the help of an English fleet. Henry VIII was willing, but never actually sent the fleet.[9] On 14 August 1547, the Parliament of Scotland excluded James from the royal succession (he was then third) for the duration of his captivity.[10] Despite Henry's promises, the castle was finally taken with the help of French ships.[11]The Regent now agreed to the marriage of Mary to the Dauphin Francis, son and heir of King Henry II of France.\nIn France[edit]Queen Mary was sent to France in August 1548. James went with her or shortly earlier in July.[12]  Though only a boy of 16, he was appointed captain of the royal Garde \u00c9cossaise (Scots Guard),[13], and in 1557 distinguished himself in the defence of St. Quentin.[4] For arranging the marriage of Mary and Francis, the Regent was made Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault, and James succeeded him as Earl of Arran. He would not inherit the French title, his father having forfeited it in 1559.[4]James became admired in France. In 1549, Emblemata (a collection of illustrated Latin proverbs and mottos compiled by Italian jurist Andrea Alciato) appeared in a French edition (Emblemes D'Alciat.),[14] which was dedicated to James.[15]\nOne of his personal devices was a heart pierced with an arrow pointing down.[16]On 24 January 1553, the French royal armourer B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Claye received an order for a suit of armour for James, to be delivered before 8 April 1553. The armour was decorated with engraved and gilded borders, and included a morion, a bourguignon, and accessories .[17]Possible French brides[edit]In April 1548, Henry II offered Fran\u00e7oise, daughter of the Duke of Montpensier, as a bride for Arran.[18]\nLater, after Mary was betrothed to the Dauphin, a number of ladies of the court were suggested as brides for James. One was Mademoiselle de Bouillon, daughter of Henry II and his mistress Diane de Poitiers, In May 1557.[19] Others were Claude de Rieux, Louise de Rieux (who married Ren\u00e9, Marquis of Elbeuf), and Jeane de Savoie. But again James did not marry.[20]Queen Elizabeth[edit]James' father gave up the Regency in 1556, and switched to a pro-English policy. It has been suggested that James was imprisoned in France as a Protestant in 1557\u20131558.[21]In 1558, the ex-Regent proposed the marriage of James to Queen Elizabeth I of England to cement an Anglo-Scottish alliance. This proposal was supported by  John Knox, the leading Protestant cleric in Scotland, and by John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury.[22]  Bishop Jewel remained in favour of the marriage as late as June 1560,[23] and Elizabeth's own opinion is not known.\nIn 1559, the ex-Regent and James openly declared themselves Protestants. James returned to Scotland escorted by English diplomat Thomas Randolph, and met another, Ralph Sadler, in Scotland. Both considered themselves his friends, but in their official correspondence, they noted signs of mental instability. Elizabeth formally declared her rejection of his suit on 8 December 1560 to the Scottish ambassadors William Maitland, the Earl of Morton and the Earl of Glencairn.[24] A later chronicler, David Hume of Godscroft, believed the marriage proposal \"so unprobable, and such a proposition as Morton knew would not be very acceptable to her,\"[25] but it was mooted by the Parliament of Scotland.[26]\"Monsieur de Beaufort\"[edit]When his father turned Protestant in June 1559, James was at his father's French estates in Ch\u00e2tellerault, perhaps at the Chateau de la Brelandiere, and became a fugitive from the French authorities.[27] He made his way to safety in Switzerland by July, reportedly spending 15 days hiding in a wood on the way.[28]  His escape from France was masterminded by Elizabeth's counselor William Cecil and the English ambassador in Paris, Nicolas Throckmorton.\nHe went first to Geneva, then to Zurich where he was the guest of Peter Martyr, and then to Lausanne.[29] There he met Thomas Randolph (alias Barnaby), and they travelled incognito to England via Flanders. In London he stayed at Cecil's Westminster home.[30] He had an interview with the Queen herself in the garden at Hampton Court.[31]At the end of June 1559, Throckmorton wrote to Cecil describing how James had been unkindly handled in France. After James had left some of his Scots Guards had brawled with some French soldiers. One of the French commissioners charged with his arrest tried to apologise to Mary, Queen of Scots, as he was her close relation. Throckmorton heard that Mary had denounced James as an \"arrant traitor,\" and he hoped that this  news would advance pro-English policy in Scotland. Throckmorton hoped the Scottish bearer of the letter, Sandy Whytelaw, would do this, and though Whytelaw was not a friend of James's father, he would raise support for the marriage of James and Elizabeth.[32]Although Elizabeth was personally sympathetic to James's plight,[33] for English policy the rescue was a step towards the objective of ending the Auld Alliance, knowing that on Arran's return his father as 'second person' of the realm would become leader of the Lords of the Congregation.[34] William Cecil acknowledged Chatelherault's thanks for the rescue, writing on 24 August, \"this one thing I covet, to have this isle well united in concord.\"\nThe name used by James while traveling through England was \"Monsieur de Beaufort\".[35]\nHis journey to Scotland was noted in the letters of Bishop Jewel to Peter Martyr and Henry Bullinger. In their correspondence, Arran was known by the codename Crito, Randolph as Pamphilus and Elizabeth as Glycerium.[36] Despite this secrecy, the English commander at Berwick, Sir James Croft was aware of the plan by 14 June.[37]Back in Scotland[edit]James went first to the castle of Berwick-upon-Tweed and met the Scottish reformer, Henry Balnaves of Halhill.[38] After a midnight ride through the Cheviot Hills,[39] At one or two o'clock in the morning of Sunday 10 September 1559, he arrived in Teviotdale, and was re-united with his father at Hamilton Palace.[40] His younger brother, Lord David Hamilton, was not so fortunate. David, aged 15, was arrested on 17 July 1559.[41] He was first imprisoned in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes and transferred in March 1560 to the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise wrapped in a blanket.[42]Lady Catherine Grey[edit]In September 1560, Sarlabous, the French Captain of Dunbar Castle, tried to spread a rumour that Elizabeth's council proposed an alternative marriage plan for Arran, with the English royal heiress Lady Catherine Grey, daughter of the Duchess of Suffolk.[43]Arran was found to be enjoying the company of an Edinburgh merchant's daughter and daughter-in-law of Cuthbert Ramsay, Alison Craig.[44] She was described by Randolph as \"a good handsome wench\" in December 1561, and the interference of the Earl of Bothwell, Lord John Stewart, Prior of Coldingham, and Ren\u00e9, Marquis of Elbeuf led to an armed stand-off.[45]Mary again[edit]Following the death of Mary's husband Francis II of France in 1560, and the apparent failure of his English marriage plan, James' father again tried to marry his son to Mary, as first suggested in their infancy.[46] Mary resisted such efforts.\nMary returned to Scotland in August 1561. James was chosen a member of her council on her arrival, but took up a hostile attitude to the court in consequence of the practice of the Roman Catholic religion.[4]George Buchanan, who was unsympathetic to Mary, suggested that in November 1561, she exploited young Arran's real affection for her by spreading a rumour that he planned to abduct her from Holyrood Palace to his residence, Kinneil House, to justify strengthening the royal bodyguard.[47] Though James' father disputed the rumour, and Thomas Randolph's findings confirm Buchanan's view, physical security was tightened at Holyrood.[48]Valiant and Stout in the Cause[edit]James joined the Lords of the Congregation and fought tirelessly against the French and Mary of Guise in the cause of the Scottish Reformation.[49] With his cousin, Robert, Master of Maxwell, on his father's orders, he attacked Crichton Castle the home of the Earl of Bothwell,[50] and Falkland Palace.[51] On 10 October 1559 James and his friends took money and silverware from Daldowie[52] and on 9 November 1559 raided the Palace of the Bishop of Dunblane, taking a gold necklace belonging to Janet, Lady Fleming, and removing the Bishop and his silver to Stirling Castle.[53] The sixty-year-old Bishop was then imprisoned at Castle Campbell till Christmas and forced to pay for his lodging.[54] In January 1559 Arran was leading the war in Fife, writing reports to Ralph Sadler and Sir James Croft from Dysart, Wemyss, Cupar and Aberdour. The French ambassador in England, Gilles de Noailles, reported that the Scottish rebels had told Queen Elizabeth that if they were victorious Arran would become King of Scotland by consent of Scottish lords with England as its superior kingdom. Scotland would pay England an annual fee and Elizabeth would add the arms of Scotland to her heraldry.[55]\nA later English document of 1583 represents the possibility that the Scottish nobility were intent on making Arran King of Scotland, because of their dissatisfaction with Mary and her French links. The nobles were;\"fullie resolved to have deprived her of her government, and established the same in the eldest sonne of the Duke of Chatteleroy, the Erle of Arreyne, beinge then a gent of verie great hope and towardnes.\"[56]Elizabeth sent a fleet to Scotland. At the end of January Arran conferred with the English Admiral William Wynter at Burntisland, saying he was about to return to his father's lands in the West, and by 4 February 1559, Fife was won over to the Congregation and pacified.[57] Later in February, Thomas Randolph posed as a Scot to gain the confidence of a French agent at Dumbarton Castle but Arran clumsily revealed his identity.[58] The centre of the conflict in Scotland moved to the Siege of Leith. An English army came to the rebels' support, arranged by the elder Arran in the Treaty of Berwick (1560). Before the English army arrived, the French  raided Glasgow and attacked the Bishop's Palace, Arran shadowed their return to Leith with 800 horse.[59]  He then joined the besiegers in the camp at Restalrig. On 4 March he met the Earl of Huntly, who seemed likely to join the Congregation, at Perth.[60] He retired from the camp at Leith by 10 April, \"evil at ease,\" to rest at Holyrood.[61] Within a week, Arran was in control of Blackness Castle, and returned to Edinburgh for the peace negotiations after the death of Mary of Guise in June, which led to the Treaty of Edinburgh.[62] After the Protestant religion was established by the Reformation Parliament, he went with Lord James to Dalhousie Castle and burnt church books and vestments.[63]Long twilight[edit]The strain of all this activity caused a mental breakdown. At Easter 1562, his father confined him to his bedchamber at Kinneil House. Arran escaped using a rope made from his bedsheets, and made his way across the Forth to Hallyards Castle and then to Falkland Palace. After accusing his enemy the Earl of Bothwell of conspiring to abduct Queen Mary, and speaking strangely of witches and devils, and \"fearing that all men round about came to kill him,\" he was judged insane and confined for the rest of his life.[64] George Buchanan, who thought the abduction plot was real and Arran a hero, said Arran was imprisoned first at St Andrews Castle, then at Edinburgh Castle where Bothwell was also held.[65] Randolph wrote to Arran's old ally Throckmorton that the Earls had fallen into a \"cesspit of their own making.\"[66] Arran was released in April 1566 and went to Hamilton, sick and without the power of speech.[67]In 1575 he inherited his father's estate, but because of his insanity he was placed under the care of his brother John. John and their other brother Claude, Abbot of Paisley kept Arran prisoner at Craignethan Castle, and though it was reported in August 1575 that if he were well-used and at liberty there was hope of recovery, he was never again allowed any freedom.[68]His mother Margaret Douglas, and aunts Elizabeth Douglas (the wife of Regent Morton) and Janet or Beatrix Douglas wife of Lord Maxwell, his sister Anne (mother of the Earl of Huntly), and youngest brother David were all also affected by mental ill-health. Thomas Randolph wrote that Arran \"has twice before been in the same case,\" and his mother and aunts were \"certain times or the most part of the year distempered with an unquiet humour.\"[69] (Randolph's description of Arran's symptoms sound akin to modern diagnoses of mania and bipolar disorder although his exact psychological condition will remain unknown.)\nJohn and Claude were supporters of Mary Queen of Scots, and so in May 1579 the former Regent Morton seized Hamilton and Craignethan on the pretence of rescuing James from his imprisonment.[4] John and Claude fled to England, but Arran, his mother, and Lord David were taken to Linlithgow,[70] and his estates were taken over by the government. In 1581 his Earldom was taken by James Stewart (died 1595), but restored in 1585 along with his estates.[4] Little is recorded of James in these later years: he died in 1609[71] and, as he was unmarried, his title passed to his nephew James, 2nd marquess.[4]Ancestors[edit].mw-parser-output table.ahnentafel{border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0;line-height:130%}.mw-parser-output .ahnentafel tr{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .ahnentafel-t{border-top:#000 solid 1px;border-left:#000 solid 1px}.mw-parser-output .ahnentafel-b{border-bottom:#000 solid 1px;border-left:#000 solid 1px}Ancestors of James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of ArranSir James Hamilton of Cadzow, 5th Laird of CadzowJames Hamilton, 1st Lord HamiltonJanet LivingstonJames Hamilton, 1st Earl of ArranJames II of ScotlandMary Stewart, Princess of ScotlandMary of GueldersJames Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault, Regent Arran, 2nd Earl of Arran,John Beaton, 6th Laird of BalfourSir David Beaton of CreichMarjory BoswellJanet Beaton of Creich, Lady of Easter WemyssStephen DuddingstonJanet DuddingstonJames Hamilton, 3rd Earl of ArranJames Douglas, 1st Earl of MortonJohn Douglas, 2nd Earl of MortonJoan of Scotland, Countess of MortonJames Douglas, 3rd Earl of MortonSir Patrick CrichtonJanet CrichtonLady Margaret DouglasJames III of ScotlandJames IV of ScotlandMargaret of DenmarkCatherine StewartArchibald BoydMarion BoydChristian MureFurther reading[edit]Bain, Joseph ed., Calendar of the State Papers relating to Scotland and Mary Queen of Scots 1547\u20131603, vol. 1, H.M.

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (October 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Josephine Balsamo (a.k.a. Countess Cagliostro) is a fictional character who is the best known antagonist of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, the notorious gentleman burglar created by Maurice Leblanc.\nContents1History2Speculation3Bibliography4In other media\n\nHistory[edit]Josephine Balsamo claims to be Jos\u00e9phine Pellegrini, born on 29 July 1788 in Palermo, from the notorious Joseph Balsamo, a.k.a. Alessandro Cagliostro, and Jos\u00e9phine Tascher de la Pagerie, the maiden name of Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, the future wife of Napoleon. She allegedly somehow achieved eternal youth. Lupin, however, theorizes that this may be nothing more than a ruse, and that she is actually the granddaughter of the first Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo, who might not be related to Joseph Balsamo at all.\nIn 1894, a 20-year-old Ars\u00e8ne Lupin came face-to-face with, and eventually became the lover of, Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo, who had already heard of him and of his reputation. From her, young Lupin learned the four secrets of Queen Marie Antoinette and Cagliostro:\n1) ALCOR, or the Seven-Armed Candlestick;\n2) The Hollow Needle;\n3) The God-Stone of the King of Bohemia; and\n4) In Robore Fortuna.\nIn 1899, after the death in childbirth of Clarisse d'Etigues, Lupin's wife, the baby son, Jean, was kidnapped by men working for Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo.\nIn 1918, Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo died in Corsica, but not without having put in motion a diabolical plan of revenge.\nIn 1924, Lupin finally stumbled upon his son Jean, now called Felicien Charles, who had been framed for a crime he did not commit, then was pitted against his father by Jos\u00e9phine's former henchmen. In the end, Lupin saved his son, but did not tell him that he was his father.\nSpeculation[edit]Wold Newton family scholar Jean-Marc Lofficier has theorized that the first Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo had an affair with the norious criminal Henri de Belcamp, a.k.a. John Devil, whose story was recorded in the eponymous book by Paul F\u00e9val, p\u00e8re as part of his chronicles Les Habits Noirs and recently continued by Brian Stableford.\nFrom that union was born a daughter, Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo II, who led a criminal career under the alias of F\u00e9lina de Cambure, whose exploits were recorded in the eponymous work by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Souli\u00e9.\nJos\u00e9phine II (F\u00e9lina) in turn had a liaison with Roland Richmond de Valgeneuse, a.k.a. Salvator, whose exploits were recorded by Alexandre Dumas in Les Mohicans de Paris.\nRoland and Jos\u00e9phine II had twins: Joseph, who was adopted as Joseph Fippart and grew up to become the notorious Rocambole, and Jos\u00e9phine III. Scholar Rick Lai has theorized that Jos\u00e9phine III was killed by a gangster working for Th\u00e9ophraste Lupin, Ars\u00e8ne Lupin's father.\nAs for the identity of the father of Jos\u00e9phine IV \u2014 the one who fought Ars\u00e8ne Lupin \u2014 some claim it was William Clayton. Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer (inventor of this particular Sir William Clayton as a fictional hero of as-yet-unpublished tales) does not claim this himself: in his book Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life (p. 230), he claims Clayton in his old age had an affair with the youthful Josephine. This does not seem plausible, given the chronology he is using and he uses the liaison as the parentage for the character John Clay, the man behind the Red-Headed League in the Sherlock Holmes story. This contradicts what is said about that character in that story.\nBibliography[edit]Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo was first introduced in the novel La Comtesse de Cagliostro (The Countess of Cagliostro in English) serialized in Le Journal in 1923-24 and collected in book for by Pierre Lafitte in 1924. She returned (posthumously) in La Cagliostro se venge (The Revenge of The Countess of Cagliostro), serialized in Le Journal in 1934 and collected in book form by Laffite in 1935. The two books were translated by Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier for a 2010 omnibus volume, Arsene Lupin vs Countess Cagliostro (Black Coat Press, .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN\u00a0978-1-935558-32-3), which includes a new short story by the Lofficiers relating the circumstances of Jos\u00e9phine's death.\nJos\u00e9phine Balsamo has since appeared in the anthology of literary pastiches, Tales of the Shadowmen.\nHer daughter has appeared in Jean-Marc Lofficier, Randy Lofficier and Gil Formosa's trilogy of graphic novels based on the character of Robur the Conqueror. She hates Robur, who is, in fact, Joseph Balsamo, her ancestor.

He was mainly involved in absolute differential calculus and in general relativity. Within this latter subject he gave a sound generalization of the variational principle.\nIn 1919, Palatini wrote an important article where he proposed a new approach to the variational formulation of Einstein's gravitational field equations.[3] In the same paper, Palatini also showed that the variations of Christoffel symbols constitute the coordinate components of a tensor.\nHe wrote the \"Rational Mechanics\" and \"Theory of relativity\" entries for the Hoepli Encyclopedia of Elementary mathematics.\nSee also[edit]Self-dual Palatini actionTetradic Palatini actionPalatini identityPalatini variationNotes[edit]^An Italian short biography of Attilio Palatini in Edizione Nazionale Mathematica Italiana online.^Rocco Serini, Necrologio di Attilio Palatini, Bollettino dell\u2019Unione Matematica Italiana, serie 3, volume 4 (1949), n. 3, pp. 334-335.^A.

It was directed by Chuck Jones, written by Michael Maltese, and featured the characters Pep\u00e9 Le Pew and Penelope Pussycat (all voices were done by Mel Blanc).[1] It won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film and was the first Chuck Jones-directed cartoon to win this award.\nContents1Plot2Notes3Availability4See also5References6External links\n\nPlot[edit]The owner of a perfume shop in Paris is horrified to find a skunk, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew, testing the wares inside his store. A strong and powerful gendarme, also repelled by the odor, is of no help.\nThe perfumer notices a mostly black female cat (retroactively named Penelope Pussycat), and flings her into the store, with the demand to \"Remove that skunk, that polecat pole from the premises. Avec!\". ('Avec' is French for 'with' but sounds similar the Yiddish word for 'away.') The cat slides into the shop, hitting a bureau and causing a bottle of white dye to spill and run down her back and tail (Penelope acquiring a white, skunk-like stripe is a running gag in Pep\u00e9 Le Pew shorts). Pep\u00e9 Le Pew sees her and immediately mistakes her for another skunk.\nThe cat smells Pep\u00e9's odor and immediately tries to run away, chased by Pep\u00e9. As she attempts to wiggle free from Pep\u00e9's embrace, he makes comments like, \"It is love at sight first, no?\" and \"We will make beautiful music together.\" She breaks free and attempts to wash the stripe and the smell off but is unsuccessful. She runs to a window and tries to open it, but it is stuck. She finally takes refuge inside a locked glass cabinet, much to Pep\u00e9's chagrin. Pep\u00e9 first tries to lure her out sweetly, then demands that she come out of the cabinet. She refuses, indicating that it is due to his odor. Pep\u00e9 Le Pew becomes saddened, pulls out a gun, walks out of sight and fires the weapon, presumably killing himself. Panicked, the cat rushes out only to run directly into Pep\u00e9's arms. He tells her, \"I missed, fortunately for you.\" The chase continues until Pep\u00e9 finds the cat on the windowsill. He believes she is trying to prove her love for him by committing suicide, and declares that he will save her. Pep\u00e9 grabs for her, but she slips through his arms. Pep\u00e9 then calls out: \"Vive l'amour, we die together\" and steps off the window ledge. The cat falls into a barrel of water under a rain-spout off-screen, while Pep\u00e9 lands in a can of blue paint.\nThe water washes the white stripe off the cat, and also gives her a cold. When Pep\u00e9 climbs out, he is blue. He sees the ragged-looking, sneezing wet cat but does not recognize her. He wanders off to find the \"beautiful young lady skunk.\" The soaked black cat watches his blue form walking away and she falls for him. When Pep\u00e9 goes back into the perfume shop to look for the female skunk, he hears the door shut and the lock click behind him. When he turns, he sees the drenched female cat leering at him and begins to panic, realizing that he is now the victim of love. She drops the key to the lock down her neckline as the startled Pep\u00e9 says, \"Oh, no!\" and runs away. As Pep\u00e9 runs as fast as he can, the cat follows using Pep\u00e9's familiar hopping pace. The short ends with Pep\u00e9 telling the audience: \"You know? It is possible to be too attractive,\" while continuing to run.\nNotes[edit]In 1957, this cartoon was reissued as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies. However, like all cartoons reissued between 1956\u201359, the opening title (The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down) music still plays and the original ending title was kept.\nAvailability[edit]This cartoon can be seen with the Blue Ribbon reissue on the first volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 DVD set (disc 3) and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection (disc 1). In 2011 it also appeared in Looney Tunes Super Stars' Pepe Le Pew: Zee Best of Zee Best.The oft-censored glass case/suicide sequence was used in both the Chuck Jones compilation movie The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie and Chuck Amuck: The Movie, though in the former, the scene with Penelope attempting to wash the stripe off her back is left out.See also[edit]\"(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons\", the song for which the cartoon is named.References[edit]^ abc\"For Scent-imental Reasons\".
